    "article": "Lynne Neagle AM : Okay, thank you very much. We've got some questions now on potential unintended consequences, and other matters relating to that, from Hefin David. </s> Hefin David AM : Can I ask what value you place on the work done by the Wales Institute of Social and Economic Research, Data and Methods and the presentation so far and the paper to be presented by Dr Nigel Newton? </s> Kirsty Williams AM : I always\u2014and Welsh Government are big supporters of WISERD and the work that they do, and, in fact, we need more research into Welsh education, not less. Therefore, I find their papers really helpful and help us to inform our work. I think what's really important in perhaps this piece of work is to say that I hope that, in the time where I've had an influence to influence over Welsh education, either as a backbencher or now as a Minister, equality and principles of equity have always driven what I've tried to achieve. And I would never undertake a policy reform that I thought would lead to less equity in the Welsh education system. Closing the attainment gap is a core element of the national mission for education in Wales and we would not proceed with anything that we thought could lead to an exacerbation of an achievement gap. </s> Hefin David AM : Okay. And how do you respond, then\u2014? I mean, it's a balanced paper, it looks at pros and cons and there's a mixed picture from it. How do you respond to the specific statement that Dr Nigel Newton said that the curriculum could exacerbate segregation within schools between different groups of pupils? </s> Kirsty Williams AM : Well, I think what the paper acknowledges is that there is no evidence that that will happen. These are 'coulds' and 'maybes' and things that we need, as a Government, to take into consideration as we plan this journey. There can't be any empirical research done at the moment because the curriculum isn't being delivered, but I understand, and we need listen to\u2014. If there are concerns out there in the field that these are unintended consequences that we may fall into\u2014that is the value of that piece of research that helps inform us. I have to say, though, the curriculum in itself is neither going to necessarily on its own hugely enhance equity nor detract from equity, in the sense that the curriculum is what's taught in our schools. There is an opportunity, I believe, that empowering teachers to be able to be more flexible in what they teach their children actually gives us an opportunity to deliver lessons that could be much more engaging and much more relevant to some of our schoolchildren than what they have at the moment. What will make the curriculum a success for all of our children, and I believe will have a bigger impact on children who are in danger of being left behind, are the four enabling purposes of the curriculum. So, the curriculum on its own can play a part, but it will only be as good as the four enabling elements that surround it. And that is strong leadership of our schools that ensures that there is no segregation, that has high expectation of all of our children, and delivers a curriculum within that setting that meets the needs of the children there. Secondly: excellent teaching. In the end, no education system, whatever its curriculum, can exceed the quality of the people who stand in front of our children day in, day out. So, the curriculum can be the most exciting, wonderful\u2014and I think it is exciting and I think it's wonderful\u2014it can be the most exciting, wonderful thing in the world, but if teachers can't teach it effectively, if their pedagogy is not excellent, then the content itself\u2014it won't work. Then we've got issues around assessment and accountability. So, how do you assess how children are doing in your new curriculum? How do you understand how that pupil, who has, you know\u2014who could be vulnerable for a whole host of reasons, usually reasons outside of the school\u2014? That pupil is vulnerable. How can you assess how that pupil is and move their learning along in an appropriate fashion? And then, finally, the well-being of the child. People sometimes say, 'Oh, you're going soft\u2014typical, going soft'. But what we know is that we cannot expect children to learn unless we address issues around their well-being. But we also know that poor achievement is also detrimental to a child's well-being. There's been lots and lots of research done, not in a Welsh context but in other systems, where children are kept behind for a year. That has a massive impact on their well-being. So, good achievement leads to good well-being, but good well-being also leads to good achievement, and you can't separate the two. So, the curriculum on its own will not be enough. It is the four enabling objectives that sit around it, and we have to be cognisant of the WISERD's research, of course we do, to ensure that, as we're doing our professional learning, as we're planning well-being for our children, as we think about assessment methods and how we develop a culture of strong leaders in our schools\u2014and we have some, we have many, but we need to do more to support them\u2014it is that that will make the biggest difference, not just the content of the curriculum on its own. Although I do believe the flexibility that we're allowing people will, I think, lead to a curriculum and more meaningful lessons for some children in schools who are in danger of disengaging because they don't understand why they're being asked to learn what they're learning, they don't see the relevance of what they're learning to what they may want to do or how their lives are, or they don't see themselves reflected. So, for some of our communities, they don't see themselves reflected in the curriculum that we're teaching at the moment. And, again, international research would suggest that, if you want a child to thrive, they have to see themselves and their community reflected in what they're learning in schools. </s> Hefin David AM : What the WISERD research suggests is that the senior management teams\u2014the management teams\u2014would certainly buy into what you've just said, but the classroom teachers would be a little bit more sceptical. </s> Kirsty Williams AM : As I said, classroom teachers are absolutely crucial to this, which is why, first of all, we've taken the difficult step to delay the implementation of the curriculum to give us the time that we need to make sure that it's not just school leaders but it is individual classroom practitioners who have the skills that they need to make the most of the opportunity that the curriculum allows them. </s> Hefin David AM : So, if we look at some of the statements that were in the presentation by WISERD at the seminar two comments jump out: 'We'll end up'\u2014this is from classroom teachers\u2014 'We'll end up with a different accountability framework to the aims and objectives of the new curriculum.' and 'there will be no consistency'. And consistency is the one I'd particularly like to focus on: 'there will be no consistency across all schools in how the new curriculum is delivered which could affect outcomes'. </s> Kirsty Williams AM : Well, first of all, we've just talked, haven't we, about trying to ensure that there is greater consistency and that's why we're changing our approach to the legislation around the Bill. So, in terms of progression steps, there will be a statutory framework to ensure that progression is the same wherever you are in Wales. So, as I said, we're using this report, we're using this feedback, to inform decisions going forward. In terms of\u2014. Read the first bit again. Was it\u2014[Interruption.] Accountability, yes. </s> Hefin David AM : Yes: 'different accountability framework to the aims and objectives of the new curriculum.' </s> Kirsty Williams AM : Okay. So, as always, in education, teachers\u2014understandably, because this is the regime that they have been a part of\u2014immediately don't think about their pedagogy, they think about, 'How are judgments going to be made upon me as an individual?' And what we're trying to do is ensure that we are developing another accountability regime that is indeed in line with the purposes of the curriculum and doesn't work against the purposes of the curriculum. So, I understand why teachers are concerned. They spend a lot of time thinking about accountability and how they're going to be held accountable for their practice, but, again, what we want to do is provide reassurance that we are devising an accountability regime for our system that is in line with the purposes of the curriculum and puts us in line with the mainstream thought and reform process across the world of progressive education systems. </s> Hefin David AM : It was the segregation bit I was particularly interested in and the response with regard to disadvantaged pupils and pupils of lower attainment. </s> Kirsty Williams AM : I don't\u2014. I do not believe that any changes\u2014and I would not pursue any changes that\u2014would lead to a segregation. </s> Hefin David AM : Okay. And with regard to the connection between Welsh Government and local government and the concerns that the Welsh Local Government Association and the Association of Directors of Education Wales raised, what progress\u00a0has been made on bridging the gap between\u2014? Whether it's a perception gap or a practice gap, what progress has been made on that? </s> Kirsty Williams AM : Well, I think the last time we had this conversation in the committee I said that I think the comments that the WLGA and ADEW had made were reflective of an old piece of work and were not current and up to date, and I think progress had been made in that time, and I'm pleased to report the significant progress that's been made\u2014 </s> Hefin David AM : Bridges have been built. </s> Kirsty Williams AM : Bridges have been\u2014. Well, from my perspective, the bridges were always there. But we've got renewed, energetic engagement from the WLGA and ADEW in all the arrangements that we have for the development of the curriculum and my understanding is that they have said publicly and in writing that they're very supportive of what's going on. </s> Hefin David AM : I'm sure they're watching and nodding vigorously now on Senedd.tv. </s> Kirsty Williams AM : And I will be with them tomorrow night and Friday morning and I'm sure if they've got any other views they'll let me know. </s> Hefin David AM : And the final question: there is a process, a model for this, which is Scotland. What kind of lessons are being learned from the introduction of their curriculum? </s> Kirsty Williams AM : Okay. So, I think the first thing to realise is that our curriculum is not a copycat of the Scottish curriculum, but it is always useful to reflect on how other systems have undertaken curriculum reform in their nation and to learn from any issues that have arisen. So, I think it's fair to say\u2014and I spent time with some delegates from Scotland just this weekend at the Atlantic Rim Collaboratory conference that Wales hosted this year. Unfortunately, Minister Swinney was not able to attend at the very last minute because of Brexit preparedness work that he was involved in, but certainly their teaching union and their equivalent of the EWC in Scotland joined us as well as representatives from the Scottish Government, although not John himself, and they were very frank about some of the challenges that they had faced in introducing their curriculum. Part of that is about assessment and they had not really thought\u2014. They spent all their time thinking about content and spent no time at all thinking about assessment. Assessment has been a crucial part of the process that we have been involved in. Professional learning, ensuring that the profession was properly prepared for the changes, I think they would agree that that wasn't necessarily\u2014. The middle tier, which they don't have to the\u2014. Well, they've got local authorities and regions, but whether they were truly engaged in what they were doing. So, I think we've learned\u2014. Although our curriculum isn't a copycat, as I said, we have been able to learn from, and we've had people who have been deeply involved in the Scottish experience as part of some of our curriculum and assessment groups and some of the advice that we've had in terms of developing coherence. But, Steve, I don't know if\u2014. You speak to your Scottish colleagues quite a lot. </s> Steve Davies : As I said, they're very forthright in sharing their learning and I think one of the critical elements was the extent to which assessment was considered at the outset alongside the curriculum content. So, that was critical, but we've embraced experts who were involved in that process who were part of our curriculum assessment group. So, they feed in throughout\u2014not 'don't do this because Scotland has done it', but they feed some of that learning into the system. As the Minister said, we had seven other countries from across the world giving us feedback and input over four days as to where we can continue to look at what we're doing but also checks and balances against some of their experiences with this area of reform. </s> Kirsty Williams AM : The particular focus of this year's conference was on the issue of assessment and we were joined by colleagues from Scotland, from Ireland, from Iceland, from Finland, from Saskatchewan, from Nova Scotia and from Uruguay. </s> Hefin David AM : When did that take place? </s> Kirsty Williams AM : Where? </s> Hefin David AM : When. </s> Kirsty Williams AM : The weekend just gone. </s> Hefin David AM : Right. </s> Lynne Neagle AM : Okay, thank you. Suzy. You've got a whole section on assessment, I don't know\u2014 </s> Suzy Davies AM : This isn't about assessment. </s> Lynne Neagle AM : Oh, okay. Go on, then. </s> Suzy Davies AM : So, on the basis that this is not about assessment, you mentioned that one of the lessons learned from Scotland is that they said they spent too much time on curriculum content rather than assessment. Can you tell me a little bit about what you've learned about how they quality control the content, even though the content, of course, will be completely different in Wales? </s> Kirsty Williams AM : Yes, the content would be completely different. When I said they spent too much time, I said that the focus had been in their work about just talking about content and, actually, the assessment arrangements were bolted on at the end of the process. So, the curriculum was all designed and developed, it was sent out to schools, and then the question was raised: 'Oh, actually, what assessment methods\u2014? How are going to assess how children are getting on?' But, Steve, you would have more details of their exact experience of quality control of the content\u2014 </s> Suzy Davies AM : Of the content, because every school is going to be very different at this. </s> Steve Davies : In terms of developing the guidance and the curriculum going out in January is concerned, I think\u2014again, I don't want to be overly critical, but one of the findings was that they encouraged schools to go forth and multiply in terms of the materials and ideas and concepts that were coming through. What we learnt was to actually\u2014the pioneer movement was to get a smaller group to develop those materials and look to engage through cluster groups. So, we had pioneers who worked with clusters to test the development of that concept before we were looking for schools to go away and develop a larger amount of content. So, in terms of the staging and measuring of bringing together the curriculum and the associated guidance, I think the time we've taken to actually get there and the strategy of using pioneer schools, external experts, back to pioneer schools, back to regions, or engaging regions in that, has been more measured and planned against a planned timescale, where everyone from the outset\u2014with the exception of the extension of the one year\u2014was clear on when we were going to be producing materials that would allow the profession to then take it and use it. I think\u2014. Claire, do you want to add to that, or\u2014? </s> Claire Bennett : I think, as we move forward, that kind of cluster approach remains really important. So, it's, as schools then think about, 'What am I going to do in my school?', that they're doing that in clusters together. When colleagues from the regional consortia were sharing their thinking with the curriculum assessment group last week, they were talking about the very specific and differentiated, I suppose, professional learning support that they would be offering to schools that have already done quite a lot of thinking and are quite far down this journey and then the kind of different sorts of approaches they would offer schools that are just starting out. Their emphasis was very much on this peer-to-peer sharing and support, so people aren't just going off in isolation. The other thing that will also help in that process will be the national network. So, there'll continue to be a focus for each area of learning and experience, bringing together the professional learning and the ongoing curriculum development, bringing together practitioners and experts and colleagues across the middle tier to give a bit of strategic direction and to be able to identify if there are areas where more support is needed. So, I think that a huge amount of thinking, particularly in the regions, has gone on into the practical support that can be given to schools, not just in engaging with the curriculum now, but then how they take it and think about then developing it in their schools. It feels like\u2014I think Graham Donaldson was calling it a 'slow-burn process'. You don't start in 2022\u2014people are already doing it and there's a lot of thought going into how to support continued sharing through the next two years. </s> Kirsty Williams AM : And I think that's another difference, you see\u2014that strong middle tier and the role that the middle tier is playing in Wales, which was absent in Scotland. So, this ability to work in networks to provide support to a network of schools, that wasn't available in the Scottish system and I think that makes\u2014I think that helps us in the way that they just simply didn't have a structure that allowed them to do that. It's not a criticism of them; it's just that we have got a structure that we can utilise to do that support so that schools are not completely left on their own and they can be working with other schools, with their regional consortia, going forward. </s> Suzy Davies AM : Can I just have a quick\u2014? </s> Lynne Neagle AM : Very quickly, because I want to move on to implementation. </s> Suzy Davies AM : Yes, sorry, I completely understand. Was one of the things that Scotland did\u2014I don't want to use the word 'assess'\u2014to monitor the pupil response to the curriculum as one of the means of deciding whether curricula in particular schools were working well enough? </s> Kirsty Williams AM : I don't know if they\u2014. I don't know if they did, but one of the interesting things that we were reflecting on over the weekend is that, certainly some of the Canadian systems, in particular, which we were interested in, used pupil surveys as part of their accountability regime\u2014so, actually taking the time to ask students how they felt, not just about the content of the new curriculum, but actually how they felt their school was doing. And so we're interested in looking, as I said, at some of the practices that other countries use to include pupil voice to find out what's happening. </s> Suzy Davies AM : Okay, that's interesting. Okay, thank you. </s> Kirsty Williams AM : Yes. I mean, it's early thoughts, because we've only just heard about it ourselves. But that's the beauty of working with other countries. They found that particular useful and successful, and we're keen to see if we could do something similar.",

    "article": "Lynne Neagle AM : Okay, thank you very much. We've got some questions now on potential unintended consequences, and other matters relating to that, from Hefin David. </s> Hefin David AM : Can I ask what value you place on the work done by the Wales Institute of Social and Economic Research, Data and Methods and the presentation so far and the paper to be presented by Dr Nigel Newton? </s> Kirsty Williams AM : I always\u2014and Welsh Government are big supporters of WISERD and the work that they do, and, in fact, we need more research into Welsh education, not less. Therefore, I find their papers really helpful and help us to inform our work. I think what's really important in perhaps this piece of work is to say that I hope that, in the time where I've had an influence to influence over Welsh education, either as a backbencher or now as a Minister, equality and principles of equity have always driven what I've tried to achieve. And I would never undertake a policy reform that I thought would lead to less equity in the Welsh education system. Closing the attainment gap is a core element of the national mission for education in Wales and we would not proceed with anything that we thought could lead to an exacerbation of an achievement gap. </s> Hefin David AM : Okay. And how do you respond, then\u2014? I mean, it's a balanced paper, it looks at pros and cons and there's a mixed picture from it. How do you respond to the specific statement that Dr Nigel Newton said that the curriculum could exacerbate segregation within schools between different groups of pupils? </s> Kirsty Williams AM : Well, I think what the paper acknowledges is that there is no evidence that that will happen. These are 'coulds' and 'maybes' and things that we need, as a Government, to take into consideration as we plan this journey. There can't be any empirical research done at the moment because the curriculum isn't being delivered, but I understand, and we need listen to\u2014. If there are concerns out there in the field that these are unintended consequences that we may fall into\u2014that is the value of that piece of research that helps inform us. I have to say, though, the curriculum in itself is neither going to necessarily on its own hugely enhance equity nor detract from equity, in the sense that the curriculum is what's taught in our schools. There is an opportunity, I believe, that empowering teachers to be able to be more flexible in what they teach their children actually gives us an opportunity to deliver lessons that could be much more engaging and much more relevant to some of our schoolchildren than what they have at the moment. What will make the curriculum a success for all of our children, and I believe will have a bigger impact on children who are in danger of being left behind, are the four enabling purposes of the curriculum. So, the curriculum on its own can play a part, but it will only be as good as the four enabling elements that surround it. And that is strong leadership of our schools that ensures that there is no segregation, that has high expectation of all of our children, and delivers a curriculum within that setting that meets the needs of the children there. Secondly: excellent teaching. In the end, no education system, whatever its curriculum, can exceed the quality of the people who stand in front of our children day in, day out. So, the curriculum can be the most exciting, wonderful\u2014and I think it is exciting and I think it's wonderful\u2014it can be the most exciting, wonderful thing in the world, but if teachers can't teach it effectively, if their pedagogy is not excellent, then the content itself\u2014it won't work. Then we've got issues around assessment and accountability. So, how do you assess how children are doing in your new curriculum? How do you understand how that pupil, who has, you know\u2014who could be vulnerable for a whole host of reasons, usually reasons outside of the school\u2014? That pupil is vulnerable. How can you assess how that pupil is and move their learning along in an appropriate fashion? And then, finally, the well-being of the child. People sometimes say, 'Oh, you're going soft\u2014typical, going soft'. But what we know is that we cannot expect children to learn unless we address issues around their well-being. But we also know that poor achievement is also detrimental to a child's well-being. There's been lots and lots of research done, not in a Welsh context but in other systems, where children are kept behind for a year. That has a massive impact on their well-being. So, good achievement leads to good well-being, but good well-being also leads to good achievement, and you can't separate the two. So, the curriculum on its own will not be enough. It is the four enabling objectives that sit around it, and we have to be cognisant of the WISERD's research, of course we do, to ensure that, as we're doing our professional learning, as we're planning well-being for our children, as we think about assessment methods and how we develop a culture of strong leaders in our schools\u2014and we have some, we have many, but we need to do more to support them\u2014it is that that will make the biggest difference, not just the content of the curriculum on its own. Although I do believe the flexibility that we're allowing people will, I think, lead to a curriculum and more meaningful lessons for some children in schools who are in danger of disengaging because they don't understand why they're being asked to learn what they're learning, they don't see the relevance of what they're learning to what they may want to do or how their lives are, or they don't see themselves reflected. So, for some of our communities, they don't see themselves reflected in the curriculum that we're teaching at the moment. And, again, international research would suggest that, if you want a child to thrive, they have to see themselves and their community reflected in what they're learning in schools. </s> Hefin David AM : What the WISERD research suggests is that the senior management teams\u2014the management teams\u2014would certainly buy into what you've just said, but the classroom teachers would be a little bit more sceptical. </s> Kirsty Williams AM : As I said, classroom teachers are absolutely crucial to this, which is why, first of all, we've taken the difficult step to delay the implementation of the curriculum to give us the time that we need to make sure that it's not just school leaders but it is individual classroom practitioners who have the skills that they need to make the most of the opportunity that the curriculum allows them. </s> Hefin David AM : So, if we look at some of the statements that were in the presentation by WISERD at the seminar two comments jump out: 'We'll end up'\u2014this is from classroom teachers\u2014 'We'll end up with a different accountability framework to the aims and objectives of the new curriculum.' and 'there will be no consistency'. And consistency is the one I'd particularly like to focus on: 'there will be no consistency across all schools in how the new curriculum is delivered which could affect outcomes'. </s> Kirsty Williams AM : Well, first of all, we've just talked, haven't we, about trying to ensure that there is greater consistency and that's why we're changing our approach to the legislation around the Bill. So, in terms of progression steps, there will be a statutory framework to ensure that progression is the same wherever you are in Wales. So, as I said, we're using this report, we're using this feedback, to inform decisions going forward. In terms of\u2014. Read the first bit again. Was it\u2014[Interruption.] Accountability, yes. </s> Hefin David AM : Yes: 'different accountability framework to the aims and objectives of the new curriculum.' </s> Kirsty Williams AM : Okay. So, as always, in education, teachers\u2014understandably, because this is the regime that they have been a part of\u2014immediately don't think about their pedagogy, they think about, 'How are judgments going to be made upon me as an individual?'

Therefore, I find their papers really helpful and help us to inform our work. I think what's really important in perhaps this piece of work is to say that I hope that, in the time where I've had an influence to influence over Welsh education, either as a backbencher or now as a Minister, equality and principles of equity have always driven what I've tried to achieve. And I would never undertake a policy reform that I thought would lead to less equity in the Welsh education system. Closing the attainment gap is a core element of the national mission for education in Wales and we would not proceed with anything that we thought could lead to an exacerbation of an achievement gap. </s> Hefin David AM : Okay. And how do you respond, then\u2014? I mean, it's a balanced paper, it looks at pros and cons and there's a mixed picture from it. How do you respond to the specific statement that Dr Nigel Newton said that the curriculum could exacerbate segregation within schools between different groups of pupils? </s> Kirsty Williams AM : Well, I think what the paper acknowledges is that there is no evidence that that will happen. These are 'coulds' and 'maybes' and things that we need, as a Government, to take into consideration as we plan this journey. There can't be any empirical research done at the moment because the curriculum isn't being delivered, but I understand, and we need listen to\u2014. If there are concerns out there in the field that these are unintended consequences that we may fall into\u2014that is the value of that piece of research that helps inform us. I have to say, though, the curriculum in itself is neither going to necessarily on its own hugely enhance equity nor detract from equity, in the sense that the curriculum is what's taught in our schools. There is an opportunity, I believe, that empowering teachers to be able to be more flexible in what they teach their children actually gives us an opportunity to deliver lessons that could be much more engaging and much more relevant to some of our schoolchildren than what they have at the moment. What will make the curriculum a success for all of our children, and I believe will have a bigger impact on children who are in danger of being left behind, are the four enabling purposes of the curriculum. So, the curriculum on its own can play a part, but it will only be as good as the four enabling elements that surround it. And that is strong leadership of our schools that ensures that there is no segregation, that has high expectation of all of our children, and delivers a curriculum within that setting that meets the needs of the children there. Secondly: excellent teaching. In the end, no education system, whatever its curriculum, can exceed the quality of the people who stand in front of our children day in, day out. So, the curriculum can be the most exciting, wonderful\u2014and I think it is exciting and I think it's wonderful\u2014it can be the most exciting, wonderful thing in the world, but if teachers can't teach it effectively, if their pedagogy is not excellent, then the content itself\u2014it won't work. Then we've got issues around assessment and accountability. So, how do you assess how children are doing in your new curriculum? How do you understand how that pupil, who has, you know\u2014who could be vulnerable for a whole host of reasons, usually reasons outside of the school\u2014? That pupil is vulnerable. How can you assess how that pupil is and move their learning along in an appropriate fashion? And then, finally, the well-being of the child. People sometimes say, 'Oh, you're going soft\u2014typical, going soft'. But what we know is that we cannot expect children to learn unless we address issues around their well-being. But we also know that poor achievement is also detrimental to a child's well-being. There's been lots and lots of research done, not in a Welsh context but in other systems, where children are kept behind for a year. That has a massive impact on their well-being. So, good achievement leads to good well-being, but good well-being also leads to good achievement, and you can't separate the two. So, the curriculum on its own will not be enough. It is the four enabling objectives that sit around it, and we have to be cognisant of the WISERD's research, of course we do, to ensure that, as we're doing our professional learning, as we're planning well-being for our children, as we think about assessment methods and how we develop a culture of strong leaders in our schools\u2014and we have some, we have many, but we need to do more to support them\u2014it is that that will make the biggest difference, not just the content of the curriculum on its own. Although I do believe the flexibility that we're allowing people will, I think, lead to a curriculum and more meaningful lessons for some children in schools who are in danger of disengaging because they don't understand why they're being asked to learn what they're learning, they don't see the relevance of what they're learning to what they may want to do or how their lives are, or they don't see themselves reflected. So, for some of our communities, they don't see themselves reflected in the curriculum that we're teaching at the moment. And, again, international research would suggest that, if you want a child to thrive, they have to see themselves and their community reflected in what they're learning in schools. </s> Hefin David AM : What the WISERD research suggests is that the senior management teams\u2014the management teams\u2014would certainly buy into what you've just said, but the classroom teachers would be a little bit more sceptical. </s> Kirsty Williams AM : As I said, classroom teachers are absolutely crucial to this, which is why, first of all, we've taken the difficult step to delay the implementation of the curriculum to give us the time that we need to make sure that it's not just school leaders but it is individual classroom practitioners who have the skills that they need to make the most of the opportunity that the curriculum allows them. </s> Hefin David AM : So, if we look at some of the statements that were in the presentation by WISERD at the seminar two comments jump out: 'We'll end up'\u2014this is from classroom teachers\u2014 'We'll end up with a different accountability framework to the aims and objectives of the new curriculum.' and 'there will be no consistency'. And consistency is the one I'd particularly like to focus on: 'there will be no consistency across all schools in how the new curriculum is delivered which could affect outcomes'. </s> Kirsty Williams AM : Well, first of all, we've just talked, haven't we, about trying to ensure that there is greater consistency and that's why we're changing our approach to the legislation around the Bill. So, in terms of progression steps, there will be a statutory framework to ensure that progression is the same wherever you are in Wales. So, as I said, we're using this report, we're using this feedback, to inform decisions going forward. In terms of\u2014. Read the first bit again. Was it\u2014[Interruption.] Accountability, yes. </s> Hefin David AM : Yes: 'different accountability framework to the aims and objectives of the new curriculum.' </s> Kirsty Williams AM : Okay. So, as always, in education, teachers\u2014understandably, because this is the regime that they have been a part of\u2014immediately don't think about their pedagogy, they think about, 'How are judgments going to be made upon me as an individual?' And what we're trying to do is ensure that we are developing another accountability regime that is indeed in line with the purposes of the curriculum and doesn't work against the purposes of the curriculum. So, I understand why teachers are concerned. They spend a lot of time thinking about accountability and how they're going to be held accountable for their practice, but, again, what we want to do is provide reassurance that we are devising an accountability regime for our system that is in line with the purposes of the curriculum and puts us in line with the mainstream thought and reform process across the world of progressive education systems. </s> Hefin David AM : It was the segregation bit I was particularly interested in and the response with regard to disadvantaged pupils and pupils of lower attainment. </s> Kirsty Williams AM : I don't\u2014. I do not believe that any changes\u2014and I would not pursue any changes that\u2014would lead to a segregation. </s> Hefin David AM : Okay. And with regard to the connection between Welsh Government and local government and the concerns that the Welsh Local Government Association and the Association of Directors of Education Wales raised, what progress\u00a0has been made on bridging the gap between\u2014? Whether it's a perception gap or a practice gap, what progress has been made on that? </s> Kirsty Williams AM : Well, I think the last time we had this conversation in the committee I said that I think the comments that the WLGA and ADEW had made were reflective of an old piece of work and were not current and up to date, and I think progress had been made in that time, and I'm pleased to report the significant progress that's been made\u2014 </s> Hefin David AM : Bridges have been built. </s> Kirsty Williams AM : Bridges have been\u2014. Well, from my perspective, the bridges were always there. But we've got renewed, energetic engagement from the WLGA and ADEW in all the arrangements that we have for the development of the curriculum and my understanding is that they have said publicly and in writing that they're very supportive of what's going on. </s> Hefin David AM : I'm sure they're watching and nodding vigorously now on Senedd.tv. </s> Kirsty Williams AM : And I will be with them tomorrow night and Friday morning and I'm sure if they've got any other views they'll let me know. </s> Hefin David AM : And the final question: there is a process, a model for this, which is Scotland. What kind of lessons are being learned from the introduction of their curriculum? </s> Kirsty Williams AM : Okay. So, I think the first thing to realise is that our curriculum is not a copycat of the Scottish curriculum, but it is always useful to reflect on how other systems have undertaken curriculum reform in their nation and to learn from any issues that have arisen. So, I think it's fair to say\u2014and I spent time with some delegates from Scotland just this weekend at the Atlantic Rim Collaboratory conference that Wales hosted this year. Unfortunately, Minister Swinney was not able to attend at the very last minute because of Brexit preparedness work that he was involved in, but certainly their teaching union and their equivalent of the EWC in Scotland joined us as well as representatives from the Scottish Government, although not John himself, and they were very frank about some of the challenges that they had faced in introducing their curriculum. Part of that is about assessment and they had not really thought\u2014. They spent all their time thinking about content and spent no time at all thinking about assessment. Assessment has been a crucial part of the process that we have been involved in. Professional learning, ensuring that the profession was properly prepared for the changes, I think they would agree that that wasn't necessarily\u2014. The middle tier, which they don't have to the\u2014. Well, they've got local authorities and regions, but whether they were truly engaged in what they were doing. So, I think we've learned\u2014. Although our curriculum isn't a copycat, as I said, we have been able to learn from, and we've had people who have been deeply involved in the Scottish experience as part of some of our curriculum and assessment groups and some of the advice that we've had in terms of developing coherence. But, Steve, I don't know if\u2014. You speak to your Scottish colleagues quite a lot. </s> Steve Davies : As I said, they're very forthright in sharing their learning and I think one of the critical elements was the extent to which assessment was considered at the outset alongside the curriculum content. So, that was critical, but we've embraced experts who were involved in that process who were part of our curriculum assessment group. So, they feed in throughout\u2014not 'don't do this because Scotland has done it', but they feed some of that learning into the system. As the Minister said, we had seven other countries from across the world giving us feedback and input over four days as to where we can continue to look at what we're doing but also checks and balances against some of their experiences with this area of reform. </s> Kirsty Williams AM : The particular focus of this year's conference was on the issue of assessment and we were joined by colleagues from Scotland, from Ireland, from Iceland, from Finland, from Saskatchewan, from Nova Scotia and from Uruguay. </s> Hefin David AM : When did that take place? </s> Kirsty Williams AM : Where? </s> Hefin David AM : When. </s> Kirsty Williams AM : The weekend just gone. </s> Hefin David AM : Right. </s> Lynne Neagle AM : Okay, thank you. Suzy. You've got a whole section on assessment, I don't know\u2014 </s> Suzy Davies AM : This isn't about assessment. </s> Lynne Neagle AM : Oh, okay. Go on, then. </s> Suzy Davies AM : So, on the basis that this is not about assessment, you mentioned that one of the lessons learned from Scotland is that they said they spent too much time on curriculum content rather than assessment. Can you tell me a little bit about what you've learned about how they quality control the content, even though the content, of course, will be completely different in Wales? </s> Kirsty Williams AM : Yes, the content would be completely different. When I said they spent too much time, I said that the focus had been in their work about just talking about content and, actually, the assessment arrangements were bolted on at the end of the process. So, the curriculum was all designed and developed, it was sent out to schools, and then the question was raised: 'Oh, actually, what assessment methods\u2014? How are going to assess how children are getting on?' But, Steve, you would have more details of their exact experience of quality control of the content\u2014 </s> Suzy Davies AM : Of the content, because every school is going to be very different at this. </s> Steve Davies : In terms of developing the guidance and the curriculum going out in January is concerned, I think\u2014again, I don't want to be overly critical, but one of the findings was that they encouraged schools to go forth and multiply in terms of the materials and ideas and concepts that were coming through. What we learnt was to actually\u2014the pioneer movement was to get a smaller group to develop those materials and look to engage through cluster groups. So, we had pioneers who worked with clusters to test the development of that concept before we were looking for schools to go away and develop a larger amount of content. So, in terms of the staging and measuring of bringing together the curriculum and the associated guidance, I think the time we've taken to actually get there and the strategy of using pioneer schools, external experts, back to pioneer schools, back to regions, or engaging regions in that, has been more measured and planned against a planned timescale, where everyone from the outset\u2014with the exception of the extension of the one year\u2014was clear on when we were going to be producing materials that would allow the profession to then take it and use it. I think\u2014. Claire, do you want to add to that, or\u2014? </s> Claire Bennett : I think, as we move forward, that kind of cluster approach remains really important. So, it's, as schools then think about, 'What am I going to do in my school?', that they're doing that in clusters together. When colleagues from the regional consortia were sharing their thinking with the curriculum assessment group last week, they were talking about the very specific and differentiated, I suppose, professional learning support that they would be offering to schools that have already done quite a lot of thinking and are quite far down this journey and then the kind of different sorts of approaches they would offer schools that are just starting out. Their emphasis was very much on this peer-to-peer sharing and support, so people aren't just going off in isolation. The other thing that will also help in that process will be the national network. So, there'll continue to be a focus for each area of learning and experience, bringing together the professional learning and the ongoing curriculum development, bringing together practitioners and experts and colleagues across the middle tier to give a bit of strategic direction and to be able to identify if there are areas where more support is needed. So, I think that a huge amount of thinking, particularly in the regions, has gone on into the practical support that can be given to schools, not just in engaging with the curriculum now, but then how they take it and think about then developing it in their schools. It feels like\u2014I think Graham Donaldson was calling it a 'slow-burn process'. You don't start in 2022\u2014people are already doing it and there's a lot of thought going into how to support continued sharing through the next two years. </s> Kirsty Williams AM : And I think that's another difference, you see\u2014that strong middle tier and the role that the middle tier is playing in Wales, which was absent in Scotland. So, this ability to work in networks to provide support to a network of schools, that wasn't available in the Scottish system and I think that makes\u2014I think that helps us in the way that they just simply didn't have a structure that allowed them to do that. It's not a criticism of them; it's just that we have got a structure that we can utilise to do that support so that schools are not completely left on their own and they can be working with other schools, with their regional consortia, going forward. </s> Suzy Davies AM : Can I just have a quick\u2014? </s> Lynne Neagle AM : Very quickly, because I want to move on to implementation. </s> Suzy Davies AM : Yes, sorry, I completely understand. Was one of the things that Scotland did\u2014I don't want to use the word 'assess'\u2014to monitor the pupil response to the curriculum as one of the means of deciding whether curricula in particular schools were working well enough? </s> Kirsty Williams AM : I don't know if they\u2014. I don't know if they did, but one of the interesting things that we were reflecting on over the weekend is that, certainly some of the Canadian systems, in particular, which we were interested in, used pupil surveys as part of their accountability regime\u2014so, actually taking the time to ask students how they felt, not just about the content of the new curriculum, but actually how they felt their school was doing. And so we're interested in looking, as I said, at some of the practices that other countries use to include pupil voice to find out what's happening. </s> Suzy Davies AM : Okay, that's interesting. Okay, thank you. </s> Kirsty Williams AM : Yes. I mean, it's early thoughts, because we've only just heard about it ourselves. But that's the beauty of working with other countries. They found that particular useful and successful, and we're keen to see if we could do something similar.",

Can you tell me a little bit about what you've learned about how they quality control the content, even though the content, of course, will be completely different in Wales? </s> Kirsty Williams AM : Yes, the content would be completely different. When I said they spent too much time, I said that the focus had been in their work about just talking about content and, actually, the assessment arrangements were bolted on at the end of the process. So, the curriculum was all designed and developed, it was sent out to schools, and then the question was raised: 'Oh, actually, what assessment methods\u2014? How are going to assess how children are getting on?' But, Steve, you would have more details of their exact experience of quality control of the content\u2014 </s> Suzy Davies AM : Of the content, because every school is going to be very different at this. </s> Steve Davies : In terms of developing the guidance and the curriculum going out in January is concerned, I think\u2014again, I don't want to be overly critical, but one of the findings was that they encouraged schools to go forth and multiply in terms of the materials and ideas and concepts that were coming through. What we learnt was to actually\u2014the pioneer movement was to get a smaller group to develop those materials and look to engage through cluster groups. So, we had pioneers who worked with clusters to test the development of that concept before we were looking for schools to go away and develop a larger amount of content. So, in terms of the staging and measuring of bringing together the curriculum and the associated guidance, I think the time we've taken to actually get there and the strategy of using pioneer schools, external experts, back to pioneer schools, back to regions, or engaging regions in that, has been more measured and planned against a planned timescale, where everyone from the outset\u2014with the exception of the extension of the one year\u2014was clear on when we were going to be producing materials that would allow the profession to then take it and use it. I think\u2014. Claire, do you want to add to that, or\u2014? </s> Claire Bennett : I think, as we move forward, that kind of cluster approach remains really important. So, it's, as schools then think about, 'What am I going to do in my school?', that they're doing that in clusters together. When colleagues from the regional consortia were sharing their thinking with the curriculum assessment group last week, they were talking about the very specific and differentiated, I suppose, professional learning support that they would be offering to schools that have already done quite a lot of thinking and are quite far down this journey and then the kind of different sorts of approaches they would offer schools that are just starting out. Their emphasis was very much on this peer-to-peer sharing and support, so people aren't just going off in isolation. The other thing that will also help in that process will be the national network. So, there'll continue to be a focus for each area of learning and experience, bringing together the professional learning and the ongoing curriculum development, bringing together practitioners and experts and colleagues across the middle tier to give a bit of strategic direction and to be able to identify if there are areas where more support is needed. So, I think that a huge amount of thinking, particularly in the regions, has gone on into the practical support that can be given to schools, not just in engaging with the curriculum now, but then how they take it and think about then developing it in their schools. It feels like\u2014I think Graham Donaldson was calling it a 'slow-burn process'. You don't start in 2022\u2014people are already doing it and there's a lot of thought going into how to support continued sharing through the next two years. </s> Kirsty Williams AM : And I think that's another difference, you see\u2014that strong middle tier and the role that the middle tier is playing in Wales, which was absent in Scotland. So, this ability to work in networks to provide support to a network of schools, that wasn't available in the Scottish system and I think that makes\u2014I think that helps us in the way that they just simply didn't have a structure that allowed them to do that. It's not a criticism of them; it's just that we have got a structure that we can utilise to do that support so that schools are not completely left on their own and they can be working with other schools, with their regional consortia, going forward. </s> Suzy Davies AM : Can I just have a quick\u2014? </s> Lynne Neagle AM : Very quickly, because I want to move on to implementation. </s> Suzy Davies AM : Yes, sorry, I completely understand. Was one of the things that Scotland did\u2014I don't want to use the word 'assess'\u2014to monitor the pupil response to the curriculum as one of the means of deciding whether curricula in particular schools were working well enough? </s> Kirsty Williams AM : I don't know if they\u2014. I don't know if they did, but one of the interesting things that we were reflecting on over the weekend is that, certainly some of the Canadian systems, in particular, which we were interested in, used pupil surveys as part of their accountability regime\u2014so, actually taking the time to ask students how they felt, not just about the content of the new curriculum, but actually how they felt their school was doing. And so we're interested in looking, as I said, at some of the practices that other countries use to include pupil voice to find out what's happening. </s> Suzy Davies AM : Okay, that's interesting. Okay, thank you. </s> Kirsty Williams AM : Yes. I mean, it's early thoughts, because we've only just heard about it ourselves. But that's the beauty of working with other countries. They found that particular useful and successful, and we're keen to see if we could do something similar.",

    "article": "Lynne Neagle AM : Okay, thank you very much. We've got some questions now on potential unintended consequences, and other matters relating to that, from Hefin David. </s> Hefin David AM : Can I ask what value you place on the work done by the Wales Institute of Social and Economic Research, Data and Methods and the presentation so far and the paper to be presented by Dr Nigel Newton? </s> Kirsty Williams AM : I always\u2014and Welsh Government are big supporters of WISERD and the work that they do, and, in fact, we need more research into Welsh education, not less. Therefore, I find their papers really helpful and help us to inform our work. I think what's really important in perhaps this piece of work is to say that I hope that, in the time where I've had an influence to influence over Welsh education, either as a backbencher or now as a Minister, equality and principles of equity have always driven what I've tried to achieve. And I would never undertake a policy reform that I thought would lead to less equity in the Welsh education system. Closing the attainment gap is a core element of the national mission for education in Wales and we would not proceed with anything that we thought could lead to an exacerbation of an achievement gap. </s> Hefin David AM : Okay. And how do you respond, then\u2014? I mean, it's a balanced paper, it looks at pros and cons and there's a mixed picture from it. How do you respond to the specific statement that Dr Nigel Newton said that the curriculum could exacerbate segregation within schools between different groups of pupils? </s> Kirsty Williams AM : Well, I think what the paper acknowledges is that there is no evidence that that will happen. These are 'coulds' and 'maybes' and things that we need, as a Government, to take into consideration as we plan this journey. There can't be any empirical research done at the moment because the curriculum isn't being delivered, but I understand, and we need listen to\u2014. If there are concerns out there in the field that these are unintended consequences that we may fall into\u2014that is the value of that piece of research that helps inform us. I have to say, though, the curriculum in itself is neither going to necessarily on its own hugely enhance equity nor detract from equity, in the sense that the curriculum is what's taught in our schools. There is an opportunity, I believe, that empowering teachers to be able to be more flexible in what they teach their children actually gives us an opportunity to deliver lessons that could be much more engaging and much more relevant to some of our schoolchildren than what they have at the moment. What will make the curriculum a success for all of our children, and I believe will have a bigger impact on children who are in danger of being left behind, are the four enabling purposes of the curriculum. So, the curriculum on its own can play a part, but it will only be as good as the four enabling elements that surround it. And that is strong leadership of our schools that ensures that there is no segregation, that has high expectation of all of our children, and delivers a curriculum within that setting that meets the needs of the children there. Secondly: excellent teaching. In the end, no education system, whatever its curriculum, can exceed the quality of the people who stand in front of our children day in, day out. So, the curriculum can be the most exciting, wonderful\u2014and I think it is exciting and I think it's wonderful\u2014it can be the most exciting, wonderful thing in the world, but if teachers can't teach it effectively, if their pedagogy is not excellent, then the content itself\u2014it won't work. Then we've got issues around assessment and accountability. So, how do you assess how children are doing in your new curriculum? How do you understand how that pupil, who has, you know\u2014who could be vulnerable for a whole host of reasons, usually reasons outside of the school\u2014? That pupil is vulnerable. How can you assess how that pupil is and move their learning along in an appropriate fashion? And then, finally, the well-being of the child. People sometimes say, 'Oh, you're going soft\u2014typical, going soft'. But what we know is that we cannot expect children to learn unless we address issues around their well-being. But we also know that poor achievement is also detrimental to a child's well-being. There's been lots and lots of research done, not in a Welsh context but in other systems, where children are kept behind for a year. That has a massive impact on their well-being. So, good achievement leads to good well-being, but good well-being also leads to good achievement, and you can't separate the two. So, the curriculum on its own will not be enough. It is the four enabling objectives that sit around it, and we have to be cognisant of the WISERD's research, of course we do, to ensure that, as we're doing our professional learning, as we're planning well-being for our children, as we think about assessment methods and how we develop a culture of strong leaders in our schools\u2014and we have some, we have many, but we need to do more to support them\u2014it is that that will make the biggest difference, not just the content of the curriculum on its own. Although I do believe the flexibility that we're allowing people will, I think, lead to a curriculum and more meaningful lessons for some children in schools who are in danger of disengaging because they don't understand why they're being asked to learn what they're learning, they don't see the relevance of what they're learning to what they may want to do or how their lives are, or they don't see themselves reflected. So, for some of our communities, they don't see themselves reflected in the curriculum that we're teaching at the moment. And, again, international research would suggest that, if you want a child to thrive, they have to see themselves and their community reflected in what they're learning in schools. </s> Hefin David AM : What the WISERD research suggests is that the senior management teams\u2014the management teams\u2014would certainly buy into what you've just said, but the classroom teachers would be a little bit more sceptical. </s> Kirsty Williams AM : As I said, classroom teachers are absolutely crucial to this, which is why, first of all, we've taken the difficult step to delay the implementation of the curriculum to give us the time that we need to make sure that it's not just school leaders but it is individual classroom practitioners who have the skills that they need to make the most of the opportunity that the curriculum allows them. </s> Hefin David AM : So, if we look at some of the statements that were in the presentation by WISERD at the seminar two comments jump out: 'We'll end up'\u2014this is from classroom teachers\u2014 'We'll end up with a different accountability framework to the aims and objectives of the new curriculum.' and 'there will be no consistency'. And consistency is the one I'd particularly like to focus on: 'there will be no consistency across all schools in how the new curriculum is delivered which could affect outcomes'. </s> Kirsty Williams AM : Well, first of all, we've just talked, haven't we, about trying to ensure that there is greater consistency and that's why we're changing our approach to the legislation around the Bill. So, in terms of progression steps, there will be a statutory framework to ensure that progression is the same wherever you are in Wales. So, as I said, we're using this report, we're using this feedback, to inform decisions going forward. In terms of\u2014. Read the first bit again. Was it\u2014[Interruption.] Accountability, yes. </s> Hefin David AM : Yes: 'different accountability framework to the aims and objectives of the new curriculum.' </s> Kirsty Williams AM : Okay. So, as always, in education, teachers\u2014understandably, because this is the regime that they have been a part of\u2014immediately don't think about their pedagogy, they think about, 'How are judgments going to be made upon me as an individual?' And what we're trying to do is ensure that we are developing another accountability regime that is indeed in line with the purposes of the curriculum and doesn't work against the purposes of the curriculum. So, I understand why teachers are concerned. They spend a lot of time thinking about accountability and how they're going to be held accountable for their practice, but, again, what we want to do is provide reassurance that we are devising an accountability regime for our system that is in line with the purposes of the curriculum and puts us in line with the mainstream thought and reform process across the world of progressive education systems. </s> Hefin David AM : It was the segregation bit I was particularly interested in and the response with regard to disadvantaged pupils and pupils of lower attainment. </s> Kirsty Williams AM : I don't\u2014. I do not believe that any changes\u2014and I would not pursue any changes that\u2014would lead to a segregation. </s> Hefin David AM : Okay. And with regard to the connection between Welsh Government and local government and the concerns that the Welsh Local Government Association and the Association of Directors of Education Wales raised, what progress\u00a0has been made on bridging the gap between\u2014? Whether it's a perception gap or a practice gap, what progress has been made on that? </s> Kirsty Williams AM : Well, I think the last time we had this conversation in the committee I said that I think the comments that the WLGA and ADEW had made were reflective of an old piece of work and were not current and up to date, and I think progress had been made in that time, and I'm pleased to report the significant progress that's been made\u2014 </s> Hefin David AM : Bridges have been built. </s> Kirsty Williams AM : Bridges have been\u2014. Well, from my perspective, the bridges were always there. But we've got renewed, energetic engagement from the WLGA and ADEW in all the arrangements that we have for the development of the curriculum and my understanding is that they have said publicly and in writing that they're very supportive of what's going on. </s> Hefin David AM : I'm sure they're watching and nodding vigorously now on Senedd.tv. </s> Kirsty Williams AM : And I will be with them tomorrow night and Friday morning and I'm sure if they've got any other views they'll let me know. </s> Hefin David AM : And the final question: there is a process, a model for this, which is Scotland. What kind of lessons are being learned from the introduction of their curriculum? </s> Kirsty Williams AM : Okay. So, I think the first thing to realise is that our curriculum is not a copycat of the Scottish curriculum, but it is always useful to reflect on how other systems have undertaken curriculum reform in their nation and to learn from any issues that have arisen. So, I think it's fair to say\u2014and I spent time with some delegates from Scotland just this weekend at the Atlantic Rim Collaboratory conference that Wales hosted this year. Unfortunately, Minister Swinney was not able to attend at the very last minute because of Brexit preparedness work that he was involved in, but certainly their teaching union and their equivalent of the EWC in Scotland joined us as well as representatives from the Scottish Government, although not John himself, and they were very frank about some of the challenges that they had faced in introducing their curriculum. Part of that is about assessment and they had not really thought\u2014. They spent all their time thinking about content and spent no time at all thinking about assessment. Assessment has been a crucial part of the process that we have been involved in. Professional learning, ensuring that the profession was properly prepared for the changes, I think they would agree that that wasn't necessarily\u2014. The middle tier, which they don't have to the\u2014. Well, they've got local authorities and regions, but whether they were truly engaged in what they were doing. So, I think we've learned\u2014. Although our curriculum isn't a copycat, as I said, we have been able to learn from, and we've had people who have been deeply involved in the Scottish experience as part of some of our curriculum and assessment groups and some of the advice that we've had in terms of developing coherence. But, Steve, I don't know if\u2014. You speak to your Scottish colleagues quite a lot. </s> Steve Davies : As I said, they're very forthright in sharing their learning and I think one of the critical elements was the extent to which assessment was considered at the outset alongside the curriculum content. So, that was critical, but we've embraced experts who were involved in that process who were part of our curriculum assessment group. So, they feed in throughout\u2014not 'don't do this because Scotland has done it', but they feed some of that learning into the system. As the Minister said, we had seven other countries from across the world giving us feedback and input over four days as to where we can continue to look at what we're doing but also checks and balances against some of their experiences with this area of reform. </s> Kirsty Williams AM : The particular focus of this year's conference was on the issue of assessment and we were joined by colleagues from Scotland, from Ireland, from Iceland, from Finland, from Saskatchewan, from Nova Scotia and from Uruguay. </s> Hefin David AM : When did that take place? </s> Kirsty Williams AM : Where? </s> Hefin David AM : When. </s> Kirsty Williams AM : The weekend just gone. </s> Hefin David AM : Right. </s> Lynne Neagle AM : Okay, thank you. Suzy. You've got a whole section on assessment, I don't know\u2014 </s> Suzy Davies AM : This isn't about assessment. </s> Lynne Neagle AM : Oh, okay. Go on, then. </s> Suzy Davies AM : So, on the basis that this is not about assessment, you mentioned that one of the lessons learned from Scotland is that they said they spent too much time on curriculum content rather than assessment. Can you tell me a little bit about what you've learned about how they quality control the content, even though the content, of course, will be completely different in Wales? </s> Kirsty Williams AM : Yes, the content would be completely different. When I said they spent too much time, I said that the focus had been in their work about just talking about content and, actually, the assessment arrangements were bolted on at the end of the process. So, the curriculum was all designed and developed, it was sent out to schools, and then the question was raised: 'Oh, actually, what assessment methods\u2014? How are going to assess how children are getting on?' But, Steve, you would have more details of their exact experience of quality control of the content\u2014 </s> Suzy Davies AM : Of the content, because every school is going to be very different at this. </s> Steve Davies : In terms of developing the guidance and the curriculum going out in January is concerned, I think\u2014again, I don't want to be overly critical, but one of the findings was that they encouraged schools to go forth and multiply in terms of the materials and ideas and concepts that were coming through.

So, in terms of the staging and measuring of bringing together the curriculum and the associated guidance, I think the time we've taken to actually get there and the strategy of using pioneer schools, external experts, back to pioneer schools, back to regions, or engaging regions in that, has been more measured and planned against a planned timescale, where everyone from the outset\u2014with the exception of the extension of the one year\u2014was clear on when we were going to be producing materials that would allow the profession to then take it and use it. I think\u2014. Claire, do you want to add to that, or\u2014? </s> Claire Bennett : I think, as we move forward, that kind of cluster approach remains really important. So, it's, as schools then think about, 'What am I going to do in my school?', that they're doing that in clusters together. When colleagues from the regional consortia were sharing their thinking with the curriculum assessment group last week, they were talking about the very specific and differentiated, I suppose, professional learning support that they would be offering to schools that have already done quite a lot of thinking and are quite far down this journey and then the kind of different sorts of approaches they would offer schools that are just starting out. Their emphasis was very much on this peer-to-peer sharing and support, so people aren't just going off in isolation. The other thing that will also help in that process will be the national network. So, there'll continue to be a focus for each area of learning and experience, bringing together the professional learning and the ongoing curriculum development, bringing together practitioners and experts and colleagues across the middle tier to give a bit of strategic direction and to be able to identify if there are areas where more support is needed. So, I think that a huge amount of thinking, particularly in the regions, has gone on into the practical support that can be given to schools, not just in engaging with the curriculum now, but then how they take it and think about then developing it in their schools. It feels like\u2014I think Graham Donaldson was calling it a 'slow-burn process'. You don't start in 2022\u2014people are already doing it and there's a lot of thought going into how to support continued sharing through the next two years. </s> Kirsty Williams AM : And I think that's another difference, you see\u2014that strong middle tier and the role that the middle tier is playing in Wales, which was absent in Scotland.

It's not a criticism of them; it's just that we have got a structure that we can utilise to do that support so that schools are not completely left on their own and they can be working with other schools, with their regional consortia, going forward. </s> Suzy Davies AM : Can I just have a quick\u2014? </s> Lynne Neagle AM : Very quickly, because I want to move on to implementation. </s> Suzy Davies AM : Yes, sorry, I completely understand. Was one of the things that Scotland did\u2014I don't want to use the word 'assess'\u2014to monitor the pupil response to the curriculum as one of the means of deciding whether curricula in particular schools were working well enough? </s> Kirsty Williams AM : I don't know if they\u2014.

    "article": "Lynne Neagle AM : Okay, thank you very much. We've got some questions now on potential unintended consequences, and other matters relating to that, from Hefin David. </s> Hefin David AM : Can I ask what value you place on the work done by the Wales Institute of Social and Economic Research, Data and Methods and the presentation so far and the paper to be presented by Dr Nigel Newton? </s> Kirsty Williams AM : I always\u2014and Welsh Government are big supporters of WISERD and the work that they do, and, in fact, we need more research into Welsh education, not less. Therefore, I find their papers really helpful and help us to inform our work. I think what's really important in perhaps this piece of work is to say that I hope that, in the time where I've had an influence to influence over Welsh education, either as a backbencher or now as a Minister, equality and principles of equity have always driven what I've tried to achieve. And I would never undertake a policy reform that I thought would lead to less equity in the Welsh education system. Closing the attainment gap is a core element of the national mission for education in Wales and we would not proceed with anything that we thought could lead to an exacerbation of an achievement gap. </s> Hefin David AM : Okay. And how do you respond, then\u2014? I mean, it's a balanced paper, it looks at pros and cons and there's a mixed picture from it. How do you respond to the specific statement that Dr Nigel Newton said that the curriculum could exacerbate segregation within schools between different groups of pupils? </s> Kirsty Williams AM : Well, I think what the paper acknowledges is that there is no evidence that that will happen. These are 'coulds' and 'maybes' and things that we need, as a Government, to take into consideration as we plan this journey. There can't be any empirical research done at the moment because the curriculum isn't being delivered, but I understand, and we need listen to\u2014. If there are concerns out there in the field that these are unintended consequences that we may fall into\u2014that is the value of that piece of research that helps inform us. I have to say, though, the curriculum in itself is neither going to necessarily on its own hugely enhance equity nor detract from equity, in the sense that the curriculum is what's taught in our schools. There is an opportunity, I believe, that empowering teachers to be able to be more flexible in what they teach their children actually gives us an opportunity to deliver lessons that could be much more engaging and much more relevant to some of our schoolchildren than what they have at the moment. What will make the curriculum a success for all of our children, and I believe will have a bigger impact on children who are in danger of being left behind, are the four enabling purposes of the curriculum. So, the curriculum on its own can play a part, but it will only be as good as the four enabling elements that surround it. And that is strong leadership of our schools that ensures that there is no segregation, that has high expectation of all of our children, and delivers a curriculum within that setting that meets the needs of the children there. Secondly: excellent teaching. In the end, no education system, whatever its curriculum, can exceed the quality of the people who stand in front of our children day in, day out. So, the curriculum can be the most exciting, wonderful\u2014and I think it is exciting and I think it's wonderful\u2014it can be the most exciting, wonderful thing in the world, but if teachers can't teach it effectively, if their pedagogy is not excellent, then the content itself\u2014it won't work. Then we've got issues around assessment and accountability. So, how do you assess how children are doing in your new curriculum? How do you understand how that pupil, who has, you know\u2014who could be vulnerable for a whole host of reasons, usually reasons outside of the school\u2014? That pupil is vulnerable. How can you assess how that pupil is and move their learning along in an appropriate fashion? And then, finally, the well-being of the child. People sometimes say, 'Oh, you're going soft\u2014typical, going soft'. But what we know is that we cannot expect children to learn unless we address issues around their well-being. But we also know that poor achievement is also detrimental to a child's well-being. There's been lots and lots of research done, not in a Welsh context but in other systems, where children are kept behind for a year. That has a massive impact on their well-being. So, good achievement leads to good well-being, but good well-being also leads to good achievement, and you can't separate the two. So, the curriculum on its own will not be enough. It is the four enabling objectives that sit around it, and we have to be cognisant of the WISERD's research, of course we do, to ensure that, as we're doing our professional learning, as we're planning well-being for our children, as we think about assessment methods and how we develop a culture of strong leaders in our schools\u2014and we have some, we have many, but we need to do more to support them\u2014it is that that will make the biggest difference, not just the content of the curriculum on its own. Although I do believe the flexibility that we're allowing people will, I think, lead to a curriculum and more meaningful lessons for some children in schools who are in danger of disengaging because they don't understand why they're being asked to learn what they're learning, they don't see the relevance of what they're learning to what they may want to do or how their lives are, or they don't see themselves reflected. So, for some of our communities, they don't see themselves reflected in the curriculum that we're teaching at the moment. And, again, international research would suggest that, if you want a child to thrive, they have to see themselves and their community reflected in what they're learning in schools. </s> Hefin David AM : What the WISERD research suggests is that the senior management teams\u2014the management teams\u2014would certainly buy into what you've just said, but the classroom teachers would be a little bit more sceptical. </s> Kirsty Williams AM : As I said, classroom teachers are absolutely crucial to this, which is why, first of all, we've taken the difficult step to delay the implementation of the curriculum to give us the time that we need to make sure that it's not just school leaders but it is individual classroom practitioners who have the skills that they need to make the most of the opportunity that the curriculum allows them. </s> Hefin David AM : So, if we look at some of the statements that were in the presentation by WISERD at the seminar two comments jump out: 'We'll end up'\u2014this is from classroom teachers\u2014 'We'll end up with a different accountability framework to the aims and objectives of the new curriculum.' and 'there will be no consistency'. And consistency is the one I'd particularly like to focus on: 'there will be no consistency across all schools in how the new curriculum is delivered which could affect outcomes'. </s> Kirsty Williams AM : Well, first of all, we've just talked, haven't we, about trying to ensure that there is greater consistency and that's why we're changing our approach to the legislation around the Bill. So, in terms of progression steps, there will be a statutory framework to ensure that progression is the same wherever you are in Wales. So, as I said, we're using this report, we're using this feedback, to inform decisions going forward. In terms of\u2014. Read the first bit again. Was it\u2014[Interruption.] Accountability, yes. </s> Hefin David AM : Yes: 'different accountability framework to the aims and objectives of the new curriculum.' </s> Kirsty Williams AM : Okay. So, as always, in education, teachers\u2014understandably, because this is the regime that they have been a part of\u2014immediately don't think about their pedagogy, they think about, 'How are judgments going to be made upon me as an individual?' And what we're trying to do is ensure that we are developing another accountability regime that is indeed in line with the purposes of the curriculum and doesn't work against the purposes of the curriculum. So, I understand why teachers are concerned. They spend a lot of time thinking about accountability and how they're going to be held accountable for their practice, but, again, what we want to do is provide reassurance that we are devising an accountability regime for our system that is in line with the purposes of the curriculum and puts us in line with the mainstream thought and reform process across the world of progressive education systems. </s> Hefin David AM : It was the segregation bit I was particularly interested in and the response with regard to disadvantaged pupils and pupils of lower attainment. </s> Kirsty Williams AM : I don't\u2014. I do not believe that any changes\u2014and I would not pursue any changes that\u2014would lead to a segregation. </s> Hefin David AM : Okay. And with regard to the connection between Welsh Government and local government and the concerns that the Welsh Local Government Association and the Association of Directors of Education Wales raised, what progress\u00a0has been made on bridging the gap between\u2014? Whether it's a perception gap or a practice gap, what progress has been made on that? </s> Kirsty Williams AM : Well, I think the last time we had this conversation in the committee I said that I think the comments that the WLGA and ADEW had made were reflective of an old piece of work and were not current and up to date, and I think progress had been made in that time, and I'm pleased to report the significant progress that's been made\u2014 </s> Hefin David AM : Bridges have been built. </s> Kirsty Williams AM : Bridges have been\u2014. Well, from my perspective, the bridges were always there. But we've got renewed, energetic engagement from the WLGA and ADEW in all the arrangements that we have for the development of the curriculum and my understanding is that they have said publicly and in writing that they're very supportive of what's going on. </s> Hefin David AM : I'm sure they're watching and nodding vigorously now on Senedd.tv. </s> Kirsty Williams AM : And I will be with them tomorrow night and Friday morning and I'm sure if they've got any other views they'll let me know. </s> Hefin David AM : And the final question: there is a process, a model for this, which is Scotland. What kind of lessons are being learned from the introduction of their curriculum? </s> Kirsty Williams AM : Okay. So, I think the first thing to realise is that our curriculum is not a copycat of the Scottish curriculum, but it is always useful to reflect on how other systems have undertaken curriculum reform in their nation and to learn from any issues that have arisen. So, I think it's fair to say\u2014and I spent time with some delegates from Scotland just this weekend at the Atlantic Rim Collaboratory conference that Wales hosted this year. Unfortunately, Minister Swinney was not able to attend at the very last minute because of Brexit preparedness work that he was involved in, but certainly their teaching union and their equivalent of the EWC in Scotland joined us as well as representatives from the Scottish Government, although not John himself, and they were very frank about some of the challenges that they had faced in introducing their curriculum. Part of that is about assessment and they had not really thought\u2014. They spent all their time thinking about content and spent no time at all thinking about assessment. Assessment has been a crucial part of the process that we have been involved in. Professional learning, ensuring that the profession was properly prepared for the changes, I think they would agree that that wasn't necessarily\u2014. The middle tier, which they don't have to the\u2014. Well, they've got local authorities and regions, but whether they were truly engaged in what they were doing. So, I think we've learned\u2014. Although our curriculum isn't a copycat, as I said, we have been able to learn from, and we've had people who have been deeply involved in the Scottish experience as part of some of our curriculum and assessment groups and some of the advice that we've had in terms of developing coherence. But, Steve, I don't know if\u2014. You speak to your Scottish colleagues quite a lot. </s> Steve Davies : As I said, they're very forthright in sharing their learning and I think one of the critical elements was the extent to which assessment was considered at the outset alongside the curriculum content. So, that was critical, but we've embraced experts who were involved in that process who were part of our curriculum assessment group. So, they feed in throughout\u2014not 'don't do this because Scotland has done it', but they feed some of that learning into the system. As the Minister said, we had seven other countries from across the world giving us feedback and input over four days as to where we can continue to look at what we're doing but also checks and balances against some of their experiences with this area of reform. </s> Kirsty Williams AM : The particular focus of this year's conference was on the issue of assessment and we were joined by colleagues from Scotland, from Ireland, from Iceland, from Finland, from Saskatchewan, from Nova Scotia and from Uruguay. </s> Hefin David AM : When did that take place? </s> Kirsty Williams AM : Where? </s> Hefin David AM : When. </s> Kirsty Williams AM : The weekend just gone. </s> Hefin David AM : Right. </s> Lynne Neagle AM : Okay, thank you. Suzy. You've got a whole section on assessment, I don't know\u2014 </s> Suzy Davies AM : This isn't about assessment. </s> Lynne Neagle AM : Oh, okay. Go on, then. </s> Suzy Davies AM : So, on the basis that this is not about assessment, you mentioned that one of the lessons learned from Scotland is that they said they spent too much time on curriculum content rather than assessment. Can you tell me a little bit about what you've learned about how they quality control the content, even though the content, of course, will be completely different in Wales? </s> Kirsty Williams AM : Yes, the content would be completely different. When I said they spent too much time, I said that the focus had been in their work about just talking about content and, actually, the assessment arrangements were bolted on at the end of the process. So, the curriculum was all designed and developed, it was sent out to schools, and then the question was raised: 'Oh, actually, what assessment methods\u2014? How are going to assess how children are getting on?' But, Steve, you would have more details of their exact experience of quality control of the content\u2014 </s> Suzy Davies AM : Of the content, because every school is going to be very different at this. </s> Steve Davies : In terms of developing the guidance and the curriculum going out in January is concerned, I think\u2014again, I don't want to be overly critical, but one of the findings was that they encouraged schools to go forth and multiply in terms of the materials and ideas and concepts that were coming through. What we learnt was to actually\u2014the pioneer movement was to get a smaller group to develop those materials and look to engage through cluster groups. So, we had pioneers who worked with clusters to test the development of that concept before we were looking for schools to go away and develop a larger amount of content. So, in terms of the staging and measuring of bringing together the curriculum and the associated guidance, I think the time we've taken to actually get there and the strategy of using pioneer schools, external experts, back to pioneer schools, back to regions, or engaging regions in that, has been more measured and planned against a planned timescale, where everyone from the outset\u2014with the exception of the extension of the one year\u2014was clear on when we were going to be producing materials that would allow the profession to then take it and use it. I think\u2014. Claire, do you want to add to that, or\u2014? </s> Claire Bennett : I think, as we move forward, that kind of cluster approach remains really important. So, it's, as schools then think about, 'What am I going to do in my school?', that they're doing that in clusters together. When colleagues from the regional consortia were sharing their thinking with the curriculum assessment group last week, they were talking about the very specific and differentiated, I suppose, professional learning support that they would be offering to schools that have already done quite a lot of thinking and are quite far down this journey and then the kind of different sorts of approaches they would offer schools that are just starting out. Their emphasis was very much on this peer-to-peer sharing and support, so people aren't just going off in isolation. The other thing that will also help in that process will be the national network. So, there'll continue to be a focus for each area of learning and experience, bringing together the professional learning and the ongoing curriculum development, bringing together practitioners and experts and colleagues across the middle tier to give a bit of strategic direction and to be able to identify if there are areas where more support is needed. So, I think that a huge amount of thinking, particularly in the regions, has gone on into the practical support that can be given to schools, not just in engaging with the curriculum now, but then how they take it and think about then developing it in their schools. It feels like\u2014I think Graham Donaldson was calling it a 'slow-burn process'. You don't start in 2022\u2014people are already doing it and there's a lot of thought going into how to support continued sharing through the next two years. </s> Kirsty Williams AM : And I think that's another difference, you see\u2014that strong middle tier and the role that the middle tier is playing in Wales, which was absent in Scotland. So, this ability to work in networks to provide support to a network of schools, that wasn't available in the Scottish system and I think that makes\u2014I think that helps us in the way that they just simply didn't have a structure that allowed them to do that. It's not a criticism of them; it's just that we have got a structure that we can utilise to do that support so that schools are not completely left on their own and they can be working with other schools, with their regional consortia, going forward. </s> Suzy Davies AM : Can I just have a quick\u2014? </s> Lynne Neagle AM : Very quickly, because I want to move on to implementation. </s> Suzy Davies AM : Yes, sorry, I completely understand. Was one of the things that Scotland did\u2014I don't want to use the word 'assess'\u2014to monitor the pupil response to the curriculum as one of the means of deciding whether curricula in particular schools were working well enough? </s> Kirsty Williams AM : I don't know if they\u2014. I don't know if they did, but one of the interesting things that we were reflecting on over the weekend is that, certainly some of the Canadian systems, in particular, which we were interested in, used pupil surveys as part of their accountability regime\u2014so, actually taking the time to ask students how they felt, not just about the content of the new curriculum, but actually how they felt their school was doing. And so we're interested in looking, as I said, at some of the practices that other countries use to include pupil voice to find out what's happening. </s> Suzy Davies AM : Okay, that's interesting. Okay, thank you. </s> Kirsty Williams AM : Yes. I mean, it's early thoughts, because we've only just heard about it ourselves. But that's the beauty of working with other countries. They found that particular useful and successful, and we're keen to see if we could do something similar.",

    "article": "Lynne Neagle AM : Okay, thank you very much. We've got some questions now on potential unintended consequences, and other matters relating to that, from Hefin David. </s> Hefin David AM : Can I ask what value you place on the work done by the Wales Institute of Social and Economic Research, Data and Methods and the presentation so far and the paper to be presented by Dr Nigel Newton? </s> Kirsty Williams AM : I always\u2014and Welsh Government are big supporters of WISERD and the work that they do, and, in fact, we need more research into Welsh education, not less. Therefore, I find their papers really helpful and help us to inform our work. I think what's really important in perhaps this piece of work is to say that I hope that, in the time where I've had an influence to influence over Welsh education, either as a backbencher or now as a Minister, equality and principles of equity have always driven what I've tried to achieve. And I would never undertake a policy reform that I thought would lead to less equity in the Welsh education system. Closing the attainment gap is a core element of the national mission for education in Wales and we would not proceed with anything that we thought could lead to an exacerbation of an achievement gap. </s> Hefin David AM : Okay. And how do you respond, then\u2014? I mean, it's a balanced paper, it looks at pros and cons and there's a mixed picture from it. How do you respond to the specific statement that Dr Nigel Newton said that the curriculum could exacerbate segregation within schools between different groups of pupils? </s> Kirsty Williams AM : Well, I think what the paper acknowledges is that there is no evidence that that will happen. These are 'coulds' and 'maybes' and things that we need, as a Government, to take into consideration as we plan this journey. There can't be any empirical research done at the moment because the curriculum isn't being delivered, but I understand, and we need listen to\u2014. If there are concerns out there in the field that these are unintended consequences that we may fall into\u2014that is the value of that piece of research that helps inform us. I have to say, though, the curriculum in itself is neither going to necessarily on its own hugely enhance equity nor detract from equity, in the sense that the curriculum is what's taught in our schools. There is an opportunity, I believe, that empowering teachers to be able to be more flexible in what they teach their children actually gives us an opportunity to deliver lessons that could be much more engaging and much more relevant to some of our schoolchildren than what they have at the moment. What will make the curriculum a success for all of our children, and I believe will have a bigger impact on children who are in danger of being left behind, are the four enabling purposes of the curriculum. So, the curriculum on its own can play a part, but it will only be as good as the four enabling elements that surround it. And that is strong leadership of our schools that ensures that there is no segregation, that has high expectation of all of our children, and delivers a curriculum within that setting that meets the needs of the children there. Secondly: excellent teaching. In the end, no education system, whatever its curriculum, can exceed the quality of the people who stand in front of our children day in, day out. So, the curriculum can be the most exciting, wonderful\u2014and I think it is exciting and I think it's wonderful\u2014it can be the most exciting, wonderful thing in the world, but if teachers can't teach it effectively, if their pedagogy is not excellent, then the content itself\u2014it won't work. Then we've got issues around assessment and accountability. So, how do you assess how children are doing in your new curriculum? How do you understand how that pupil, who has, you know\u2014who could be vulnerable for a whole host of reasons, usually reasons outside of the school\u2014? That pupil is vulnerable. How can you assess how that pupil is and move their learning along in an appropriate fashion? And then, finally, the well-being of the child. People sometimes say, 'Oh, you're going soft\u2014typical, going soft'. But what we know is that we cannot expect children to learn unless we address issues around their well-being. But we also know that poor achievement is also detrimental to a child's well-being. There's been lots and lots of research done, not in a Welsh context but in other systems, where children are kept behind for a year. That has a massive impact on their well-being. So, good achievement leads to good well-being, but good well-being also leads to good achievement, and you can't separate the two. So, the curriculum on its own will not be enough. It is the four enabling objectives that sit around it, and we have to be cognisant of the WISERD's research, of course we do, to ensure that, as we're doing our professional learning, as we're planning well-being for our children, as we think about assessment methods and how we develop a culture of strong leaders in our schools\u2014and we have some, we have many, but we need to do more to support them\u2014it is that that will make the biggest difference, not just the content of the curriculum on its own. Although I do believe the flexibility that we're allowing people will, I think, lead to a curriculum and more meaningful lessons for some children in schools who are in danger of disengaging because they don't understand why they're being asked to learn what they're learning, they don't see the relevance of what they're learning to what they may want to do or how their lives are, or they don't see themselves reflected. So, for some of our communities, they don't see themselves reflected in the curriculum that we're teaching at the moment. And, again, international research would suggest that, if you want a child to thrive, they have to see themselves and their community reflected in what they're learning in schools. </s> Hefin David AM : What the WISERD research suggests is that the senior management teams\u2014the management teams\u2014would certainly buy into what you've just said, but the classroom teachers would be a little bit more sceptical. </s> Kirsty Williams AM : As I said, classroom teachers are absolutely crucial to this, which is why, first of all, we've taken the difficult step to delay the implementation of the curriculum to give us the time that we need to make sure that it's not just school leaders but it is individual classroom practitioners who have the skills that they need to make the most of the opportunity that the curriculum allows them. </s> Hefin David AM : So, if we look at some of the statements that were in the presentation by WISERD at the seminar two comments jump out: 'We'll end up'\u2014this is from classroom teachers\u2014 'We'll end up with a different accountability framework to the aims and objectives of the new curriculum.' and 'there will be no consistency'.

It's not a criticism of them; it's just that we have got a structure that we can utilise to do that support so that schools are not completely left on their own and they can be working with other schools, with their regional consortia, going forward. </s> Suzy Davies AM : Can I just have a quick\u2014? </s> Lynne Neagle AM : Very quickly, because I want to move on to implementation. </s> Suzy Davies AM : Yes, sorry, I completely understand. Was one of the things that Scotland did\u2014I don't want to use the word 'assess'\u2014to monitor the pupil response to the curriculum as one of the means of deciding whether curricula in particular schools were working well enough? </s> Kirsty Williams AM : I don't know if they\u2014. I don't know if they did, but one of the interesting things that we were reflecting on over the weekend is that, certainly some of the Canadian systems, in particular, which we were interested in, used pupil surveys as part of their accountability regime\u2014so, actually taking the time to ask students how they felt, not just about the content of the new curriculum, but actually how they felt their school was doing. And so we're interested in looking, as I said, at some of the practices that other countries use to include pupil voice to find out what's happening. </s> Suzy Davies AM : Okay, that's interesting. Okay, thank you. </s> Kirsty Williams AM : Yes. I mean, it's early thoughts, because we've only just heard about it ourselves. But that's the beauty of working with other countries. They found that particular useful and successful, and we're keen to see if we could do something similar.",

    "article": "Lynne Neagle AM : Okay, thank you very much. We've got some questions now on potential unintended consequences, and other matters relating to that, from Hefin David. </s> Hefin David AM : Can I ask what value you place on the work done by the Wales Institute of Social and Economic Research, Data and Methods and the presentation so far and the paper to be presented by Dr Nigel Newton? </s> Kirsty Williams AM : I always\u2014and Welsh Government are big supporters of WISERD and the work that they do, and, in fact, we need more research into Welsh education, not less. Therefore, I find their papers really helpful and help us to inform our work. I think what's really important in perhaps this piece of work is to say that I hope that, in the time where I've had an influence to influence over Welsh education, either as a backbencher or now as a Minister, equality and principles of equity have always driven what I've tried to achieve. And I would never undertake a policy reform that I thought would lead to less equity in the Welsh education system. Closing the attainment gap is a core element of the national mission for education in Wales and we would not proceed with anything that we thought could lead to an exacerbation of an achievement gap. </s> Hefin David AM : Okay. And how do you respond, then\u2014? I mean, it's a balanced paper, it looks at pros and cons and there's a mixed picture from it. How do you respond to the specific statement that Dr Nigel Newton said that the curriculum could exacerbate segregation within schools between different groups of pupils? </s> Kirsty Williams AM : Well, I think what the paper acknowledges is that there is no evidence that that will happen. These are 'coulds' and 'maybes' and things that we need, as a Government, to take into consideration as we plan this journey. There can't be any empirical research done at the moment because the curriculum isn't being delivered, but I understand, and we need listen to\u2014. If there are concerns out there in the field that these are unintended consequences that we may fall into\u2014that is the value of that piece of research that helps inform us. I have to say, though, the curriculum in itself is neither going to necessarily on its own hugely enhance equity nor detract from equity, in the sense that the curriculum is what's taught in our schools. There is an opportunity, I believe, that empowering teachers to be able to be more flexible in what they teach their children actually gives us an opportunity to deliver lessons that could be much more engaging and much more relevant to some of our schoolchildren than what they have at the moment. What will make the curriculum a success for all of our children, and I believe will have a bigger impact on children who are in danger of being left behind, are the four enabling purposes of the curriculum. So, the curriculum on its own can play a part, but it will only be as good as the four enabling elements that surround it. And that is strong leadership of our schools that ensures that there is no segregation, that has high expectation of all of our children, and delivers a curriculum within that setting that meets the needs of the children there. Secondly: excellent teaching. In the end, no education system, whatever its curriculum, can exceed the quality of the people who stand in front of our children day in, day out. So, the curriculum can be the most exciting, wonderful\u2014and I think it is exciting and I think it's wonderful\u2014it can be the most exciting, wonderful thing in the world, but if teachers can't teach it effectively, if their pedagogy is not excellent, then the content itself\u2014it won't work. Then we've got issues around assessment and accountability. So, how do you assess how children are doing in your new curriculum? How do you understand how that pupil, who has, you know\u2014who could be vulnerable for a whole host of reasons, usually reasons outside of the school\u2014? That pupil is vulnerable. How can you assess how that pupil is and move their learning along in an appropriate fashion? And then, finally, the well-being of the child. People sometimes say, 'Oh, you're going soft\u2014typical, going soft'. But what we know is that we cannot expect children to learn unless we address issues around their well-being. But we also know that poor achievement is also detrimental to a child's well-being. There's been lots and lots of research done, not in a Welsh context but in other systems, where children are kept behind for a year. That has a massive impact on their well-being. So, good achievement leads to good well-being, but good well-being also leads to good achievement, and you can't separate the two. So, the curriculum on its own will not be enough. It is the four enabling objectives that sit around it, and we have to be cognisant of the WISERD's research, of course we do, to ensure that, as we're doing our professional learning, as we're planning well-being for our children, as we think about assessment methods and how we develop a culture of strong leaders in our schools\u2014and we have some, we have many, but we need to do more to support them\u2014it is that that will make the biggest difference, not just the content of the curriculum on its own. Although I do believe the flexibility that we're allowing people will, I think, lead to a curriculum and more meaningful lessons for some children in schools who are in danger of disengaging because they don't understand why they're being asked to learn what they're learning, they don't see the relevance of what they're learning to what they may want to do or how their lives are, or they don't see themselves reflected. So, for some of our communities, they don't see themselves reflected in the curriculum that we're teaching at the moment. And, again, international research would suggest that, if you want a child to thrive, they have to see themselves and their community reflected in what they're learning in schools. </s> Hefin David AM : What the WISERD research suggests is that the senior management teams\u2014the management teams\u2014would certainly buy into what you've just said, but the classroom teachers would be a little bit more sceptical. </s> Kirsty Williams AM : As I said, classroom teachers are absolutely crucial to this, which is why, first of all, we've taken the difficult step to delay the implementation of the curriculum to give us the time that we need to make sure that it's not just school leaders but it is individual classroom practitioners who have the skills that they need to make the most of the opportunity that the curriculum allows them. </s> Hefin David AM : So, if we look at some of the statements that were in the presentation by WISERD at the seminar two comments jump out: 'We'll end up'\u2014this is from classroom teachers\u2014 'We'll end up with a different accountability framework to the aims and objectives of the new curriculum.' and 'there will be no consistency'. And consistency is the one I'd particularly like to focus on: 'there will be no consistency across all schools in how the new curriculum is delivered which could affect outcomes'. </s> Kirsty Williams AM : Well, first of all, we've just talked, haven't we, about trying to ensure that there is greater consistency and that's why we're changing our approach to the legislation around the Bill. So, in terms of progression steps, there will be a statutory framework to ensure that progression is the same wherever you are in Wales. So, as I said, we're using this report, we're using this feedback, to inform decisions going forward. In terms of\u2014. Read the first bit again. Was it\u2014[Interruption.] Accountability, yes. </s> Hefin David AM : Yes: 'different accountability framework to the aims and objectives of the new curriculum.' </s> Kirsty Williams AM : Okay. So, as always, in education, teachers\u2014understandably, because this is the regime that they have been a part of\u2014immediately don't think about their pedagogy, they think about, 'How are judgments going to be made upon me as an individual?' And what we're trying to do is ensure that we are developing another accountability regime that is indeed in line with the purposes of the curriculum and doesn't work against the purposes of the curriculum. So, I understand why teachers are concerned. They spend a lot of time thinking about accountability and how they're going to be held accountable for their practice, but, again, what we want to do is provide reassurance that we are devising an accountability regime for our system that is in line with the purposes of the curriculum and puts us in line with the mainstream thought and reform process across the world of progressive education systems. </s> Hefin David AM : It was the segregation bit I was particularly interested in and the response with regard to disadvantaged pupils and pupils of lower attainment. </s> Kirsty Williams AM : I don't\u2014. I do not believe that any changes\u2014and I would not pursue any changes that\u2014would lead to a segregation. </s> Hefin David AM : Okay. And with regard to the connection between Welsh Government and local government and the concerns that the Welsh Local Government Association and the Association of Directors of Education Wales raised, what progress\u00a0has been made on bridging the gap between\u2014? Whether it's a perception gap or a practice gap, what progress has been made on that? </s> Kirsty Williams AM : Well, I think the last time we had this conversation in the committee I said that I think the comments that the WLGA and ADEW had made were reflective of an old piece of work and were not current and up to date, and I think progress had been made in that time, and I'm pleased to report the significant progress that's been made\u2014 </s> Hefin David AM : Bridges have been built. </s> Kirsty Williams AM : Bridges have been\u2014. Well, from my perspective, the bridges were always there. But we've got renewed, energetic engagement from the WLGA and ADEW in all the arrangements that we have for the development of the curriculum and my understanding is that they have said publicly and in writing that they're very supportive of what's going on. </s> Hefin David AM : I'm sure they're watching and nodding vigorously now on Senedd.tv. </s> Kirsty Williams AM : And I will be with them tomorrow night and Friday morning and I'm sure if they've got any other views they'll let me know. </s> Hefin David AM : And the final question: there is a process, a model for this, which is Scotland. What kind of lessons are being learned from the introduction of their curriculum? </s> Kirsty Williams AM : Okay. So, I think the first thing to realise is that our curriculum is not a copycat of the Scottish curriculum, but it is always useful to reflect on how other systems have undertaken curriculum reform in their nation and to learn from any issues that have arisen. So, I think it's fair to say\u2014and I spent time with some delegates from Scotland just this weekend at the Atlantic Rim Collaboratory conference that Wales hosted this year. Unfortunately, Minister Swinney was not able to attend at the very last minute because of Brexit preparedness work that he was involved in, but certainly their teaching union and their equivalent of the EWC in Scotland joined us as well as representatives from the Scottish Government, although not John himself, and they were very frank about some of the challenges that they had faced in introducing their curriculum. Part of that is about assessment and they had not really thought\u2014. They spent all their time thinking about content and spent no time at all thinking about assessment. Assessment has been a crucial part of the process that we have been involved in. Professional learning, ensuring that the profession was properly prepared for the changes, I think they would agree that that wasn't necessarily\u2014. The middle tier, which they don't have to the\u2014. Well, they've got local authorities and regions, but whether they were truly engaged in what they were doing. So, I think we've learned\u2014. Although our curriculum isn't a copycat, as I said, we have been able to learn from, and we've had people who have been deeply involved in the Scottish experience as part of some of our curriculum and assessment groups and some of the advice that we've had in terms of developing coherence. But, Steve, I don't know if\u2014. You speak to your Scottish colleagues quite a lot. </s> Steve Davies : As I said, they're very forthright in sharing their learning and I think one of the critical elements was the extent to which assessment was considered at the outset alongside the curriculum content. So, that was critical, but we've embraced experts who were involved in that process who were part of our curriculum assessment group. So, they feed in throughout\u2014not 'don't do this because Scotland has done it', but they feed some of that learning into the system. As the Minister said, we had seven other countries from across the world giving us feedback and input over four days as to where we can continue to look at what we're doing but also checks and balances against some of their experiences with this area of reform. </s> Kirsty Williams AM : The particular focus of this year's conference was on the issue of assessment and we were joined by colleagues from Scotland, from Ireland, from Iceland, from Finland, from Saskatchewan, from Nova Scotia and from Uruguay. </s> Hefin David AM : When did that take place? </s> Kirsty Williams AM : Where? </s> Hefin David AM : When. </s> Kirsty Williams AM : The weekend just gone. </s> Hefin David AM : Right. </s> Lynne Neagle AM : Okay, thank you. Suzy. You've got a whole section on assessment, I don't know\u2014 </s> Suzy Davies AM : This isn't about assessment. </s> Lynne Neagle AM : Oh, okay. Go on, then. </s> Suzy Davies AM : So, on the basis that this is not about assessment, you mentioned that one of the lessons learned from Scotland is that they said they spent too much time on curriculum content rather than assessment. Can you tell me a little bit about what you've learned about how they quality control the content, even though the content, of course, will be completely different in Wales? </s> Kirsty Williams AM : Yes, the content would be completely different. When I said they spent too much time, I said that the focus had been in their work about just talking about content and, actually, the assessment arrangements were bolted on at the end of the process. So, the curriculum was all designed and developed, it was sent out to schools, and then the question was raised: 'Oh, actually, what assessment methods\u2014? How are going to assess how children are getting on?' But, Steve, you would have more details of their exact experience of quality control of the content\u2014 </s> Suzy Davies AM : Of the content, because every school is going to be very different at this. </s> Steve Davies : In terms of developing the guidance and the curriculum going out in January is concerned, I think\u2014again, I don't want to be overly critical, but one of the findings was that they encouraged schools to go forth and multiply in terms of the materials and ideas and concepts that were coming through. What we learnt was to actually\u2014the pioneer movement was to get a smaller group to develop those materials and look to engage through cluster groups. So, we had pioneers who worked with clusters to test the development of that concept before we were looking for schools to go away and develop a larger amount of content. So, in terms of the staging and measuring of bringing together the curriculum and the associated guidance, I think the time we've taken to actually get there and the strategy of using pioneer schools, external experts, back to pioneer schools, back to regions, or engaging regions in that, has been more measured and planned against a planned timescale, where everyone from the outset\u2014with the exception of the extension of the one year\u2014was clear on when we were going to be producing materials that would allow the profession to then take it and use it. I think\u2014. Claire, do you want to add to that, or\u2014? </s> Claire Bennett : I think, as we move forward, that kind of cluster approach remains really important. So, it's, as schools then think about, 'What am I going to do in my school?', that they're doing that in clusters together. When colleagues from the regional consortia were sharing their thinking with the curriculum assessment group last week, they were talking about the very specific and differentiated, I suppose, professional learning support that they would be offering to schools that have already done quite a lot of thinking and are quite far down this journey and then the kind of different sorts of approaches they would offer schools that are just starting out. Their emphasis was very much on this peer-to-peer sharing and support, so people aren't just going off in isolation. The other thing that will also help in that process will be the national network. So, there'll continue to be a focus for each area of learning and experience, bringing together the professional learning and the ongoing curriculum development, bringing together practitioners and experts and colleagues across the middle tier to give a bit of strategic direction and to be able to identify if there are areas where more support is needed. So, I think that a huge amount of thinking, particularly in the regions, has gone on into the practical support that can be given to schools, not just in engaging with the curriculum now, but then how they take it and think about then developing it in their schools. It feels like\u2014I think Graham Donaldson was calling it a 'slow-burn process'. You don't start in 2022\u2014people are already doing it and there's a lot of thought going into how to support continued sharing through the next two years. </s> Kirsty Williams AM : And I think that's another difference, you see\u2014that strong middle tier and the role that the middle tier is playing in Wales, which was absent in Scotland. So, this ability to work in networks to provide support to a network of schools, that wasn't available in the Scottish system and I think that makes\u2014I think that helps us in the way that they just simply didn't have a structure that allowed them to do that. It's not a criticism of them; it's just that we have got a structure that we can utilise to do that support so that schools are not completely left on their own and they can be working with other schools, with their regional consortia, going forward. </s> Suzy Davies AM : Can I just have a quick\u2014? </s> Lynne Neagle AM : Very quickly, because I want to move on to implementation. </s> Suzy Davies AM : Yes, sorry, I completely understand. Was one of the things that Scotland did\u2014I don't want to use the word 'assess'\u2014to monitor the pupil response to the curriculum as one of the means of deciding whether curricula in particular schools were working well enough? </s> Kirsty Williams AM : I don't know if they\u2014.

We've got some questions now on potential unintended consequences, and other matters relating to that, from Hefin David. </s> Hefin David AM : Can I ask what value you place on the work done by the Wales Institute of Social and Economic Research, Data and Methods and the presentation so far and the paper to be presented by Dr Nigel Newton? </s> Kirsty Williams AM : I always\u2014and Welsh Government are big supporters of WISERD and the work that they do, and, in fact, we need more research into Welsh education, not less.

Closing the attainment gap is a core element of the national mission for education in Wales and we would not proceed with anything that we thought could lead to an exacerbation of an achievement gap. </s> Hefin David AM : Okay. And how do you respond, then\u2014? I mean, it's a balanced paper, it looks at pros and cons and there's a mixed picture from it. How do you respond to the specific statement that Dr Nigel Newton said that the curriculum could exacerbate segregation within schools between different groups of pupils? </s> Kirsty Williams AM : Well, I think what the paper acknowledges is that there is no evidence that that will happen. These are 'coulds' and 'maybes' and things that we need, as a Government, to take into consideration as we plan this journey. There can't be any empirical research done at the moment because the curriculum isn't being delivered, but I understand, and we need listen to\u2014.

I have to say, though, the curriculum in itself is neither going to necessarily on its own hugely enhance equity nor detract from equity, in the sense that the curriculum is what's taught in our schools. There is an opportunity, I believe, that empowering teachers to be able to be more flexible in what they teach their children actually gives us an opportunity to deliver lessons that could be much more engaging and much more relevant to some of our schoolchildren than what they have at the moment. What will make the curriculum a success for all of our children, and I believe will have a bigger impact on children who are in danger of being left behind, are the four enabling purposes of the curriculum.

And that is strong leadership of our schools that ensures that there is no segregation, that has high expectation of all of our children, and delivers a curriculum within that setting that meets the needs of the children there. Secondly: excellent teaching. In the end, no education system, whatever its curriculum, can exceed the quality of the people who stand in front of our children day in, day out. So, the curriculum can be the most exciting, wonderful\u2014and I think it is exciting and I think it's wonderful\u2014it can be the most exciting, wonderful thing in the world, but if teachers can't teach it effectively, if their pedagogy is not excellent, then the content itself\u2014it won't work. Then we've got issues around assessment and accountability. So, how do you assess how children are doing in your new curriculum? How do you understand how that pupil, who has, you know\u2014who could be vulnerable for a whole host of reasons, usually reasons outside of the school\u2014? That pupil is vulnerable. How can you assess how that pupil is and move their learning along in an appropriate fashion? And then, finally, the well-being of the child. People sometimes say, 'Oh, you're going soft\u2014typical, going soft'. But what we know is that we cannot expect children to learn unless we address issues around their well-being. But we also know that poor achievement is also detrimental to a child's well-being. There's been lots and lots of research done, not in a Welsh context but in other systems, where children are kept behind for a year. That has a massive impact on their well-being. So, good achievement leads to good well-being, but good well-being also leads to good achievement, and you can't separate the two. So, the curriculum on its own will not be enough. It is the four enabling objectives that sit around it, and we have to be cognisant of the WISERD's research, of course we do, to ensure that, as we're doing our professional learning, as we're planning well-being for our children, as we think about assessment methods and how we develop a culture of strong leaders in our schools\u2014and we have some, we have many, but we need to do more to support them\u2014it is that that will make the biggest difference, not just the content of the curriculum on its own. Although I do believe the flexibility that we're allowing people will, I think, lead to a curriculum and more meaningful lessons for some children in schools who are in danger of disengaging because they don't understand why they're being asked to learn what they're learning, they don't see the relevance of what they're learning to what they may want to do or how their lives are, or they don't see themselves reflected. So, for some of our communities, they don't see themselves reflected in the curriculum that we're teaching at the moment. And, again, international research would suggest that, if you want a child to thrive, they have to see themselves and their community reflected in what they're learning in schools. </s> Hefin David AM : What the WISERD research suggests is that the senior management teams\u2014the management teams\u2014would certainly buy into what you've just said, but the classroom teachers would be a little bit more sceptical. </s> Kirsty Williams AM : As I said, classroom teachers are absolutely crucial to this, which is why, first of all, we've taken the difficult step to delay the implementation of the curriculum to give us the time that we need to make sure that it's not just school leaders but it is individual classroom practitioners who have the skills that they need to make the most of the opportunity that the curriculum allows them. </s> Hefin David AM : So, if we look at some of the statements that were in the presentation by WISERD at the seminar two comments jump out: 'We'll end up'\u2014this is from classroom teachers\u2014 'We'll end up with a different accountability framework to the aims and objectives of the new curriculum.' and 'there will be no consistency'.

They spend a lot of time thinking about accountability and how they're going to be held accountable for their practice, but, again, what we want to do is provide reassurance that we are devising an accountability regime for our system that is in line with the purposes of the curriculum and puts us in line with the mainstream thought and reform process across the world of progressive education systems. </s> Hefin David AM : It was the segregation bit I was particularly interested in and the response with regard to disadvantaged pupils and pupils of lower attainment. </s> Kirsty Williams AM : I don't\u2014. I do not believe that any changes\u2014and I would not pursue any changes that\u2014would lead to a segregation. </s> Hefin David AM : Okay.

But we've got renewed, energetic engagement from the WLGA and ADEW in all the arrangements that we have for the development of the curriculum and my understanding is that they have said publicly and in writing that they're very supportive of what's going on. </s> Hefin David AM : I'm sure they're watching and nodding vigorously now on Senedd.tv. </s> Kirsty Williams AM : And I will be with them tomorrow night and Friday morning and I'm sure if they've got any other views they'll let me know. </s> Hefin David AM : And the final question: there is a process, a model for this, which is Scotland. What kind of lessons are being learned from the introduction of their curriculum? </s> Kirsty Williams AM : Okay. So, I think the first thing to realise is that our curriculum is not a copycat of the Scottish curriculum, but it is always useful to reflect on how other systems have undertaken curriculum reform in their nation and to learn from any issues that have arisen. So, I think it's fair to say\u2014and I spent time with some delegates from Scotland just this weekend at the Atlantic Rim Collaboratory conference that Wales hosted this year. Unfortunately, Minister Swinney was not able to attend at the very last minute because of Brexit preparedness work that he was involved in, but certainly their teaching union and their equivalent of the EWC in Scotland joined us as well as representatives from the Scottish Government, although not John himself, and they were very frank about some of the challenges that they had faced in introducing their curriculum. Part of that is about assessment and they had not really thought\u2014. They spent all their time thinking about content and spent no time at all thinking about assessment. Assessment has been a crucial part of the process that we have been involved in. Professional learning, ensuring that the profession was properly prepared for the changes, I think they would agree that that wasn't necessarily\u2014. The middle tier, which they don't have to the\u2014. Well, they've got local authorities and regions, but whether they were truly engaged in what they were doing. So, I think we've learned\u2014. Although our curriculum isn't a copycat, as I said, we have been able to learn from, and we've had people who have been deeply involved in the Scottish experience as part of some of our curriculum and assessment groups and some of the advice that we've had in terms of developing coherence. But, Steve, I don't know if\u2014. You speak to your Scottish colleagues quite a lot. </s> Steve Davies : As I said, they're very forthright in sharing their learning and I think one of the critical elements was the extent to which assessment was considered at the outset alongside the curriculum content. So, that was critical, but we've embraced experts who were involved in that process who were part of our curriculum assessment group. So, they feed in throughout\u2014not 'don't do this because Scotland has done it', but they feed some of that learning into the system. As the Minister said, we had seven other countries from across the world giving us feedback and input over four days as to where we can continue to look at what we're doing but also checks and balances against some of their experiences with this area of reform. </s> Kirsty Williams AM : The particular focus of this year's conference was on the issue of assessment and we were joined by colleagues from Scotland, from Ireland, from Iceland, from Finland, from Saskatchewan, from Nova Scotia and from Uruguay. </s> Hefin David AM : When did that take place? </s> Kirsty Williams AM : Where? </s> Hefin David AM : When. </s> Kirsty Williams AM : The weekend just gone. </s> Hefin David AM : Right. </s> Lynne Neagle AM : Okay, thank you. Suzy. You've got a whole section on assessment, I don't know\u2014 </s> Suzy Davies AM : This isn't about assessment. </s> Lynne Neagle AM : Oh, okay. Go on, then. </s> Suzy Davies AM : So, on the basis that this is not about assessment, you mentioned that one of the lessons learned from Scotland is that they said they spent too much time on curriculum content rather than assessment. Can you tell me a little bit about what you've learned about how they quality control the content, even though the content, of course, will be completely different in Wales? </s> Kirsty Williams AM : Yes, the content would be completely different. When I said they spent too much time, I said that the focus had been in their work about just talking about content and, actually, the assessment arrangements were bolted on at the end of the process. So, the curriculum was all designed and developed, it was sent out to schools, and then the question was raised: 'Oh, actually, what assessment methods\u2014? How are going to assess how children are getting on?' But, Steve, you would have more details of their exact experience of quality control of the content\u2014 </s> Suzy Davies AM : Of the content, because every school is going to be very different at this. </s> Steve Davies : In terms of developing the guidance and the curriculum going out in January is concerned, I think\u2014again, I don't want to be overly critical, but one of the findings was that they encouraged schools to go forth and multiply in terms of the materials and ideas and concepts that were coming through. What we learnt was to actually\u2014the pioneer movement was to get a smaller group to develop those materials and look to engage through cluster groups. So, we had pioneers who worked with clusters to test the development of that concept before we were looking for schools to go away and develop a larger amount of content. So, in terms of the staging and measuring of bringing together the curriculum and the associated guidance, I think the time we've taken to actually get there and the strategy of using pioneer schools, external experts, back to pioneer schools, back to regions, or engaging regions in that, has been more measured and planned against a planned timescale, where everyone from the outset\u2014with the exception of the extension of the one year\u2014was clear on when we were going to be producing materials that would allow the profession to then take it and use it. I think\u2014. Claire, do you want to add to that, or\u2014? </s> Claire Bennett : I think, as we move forward, that kind of cluster approach remains really important. So, it's, as schools then think about, 'What am I going to do in my school?', that they're doing that in clusters together. When colleagues from the regional consortia were sharing their thinking with the curriculum assessment group last week, they were talking about the very specific and differentiated, I suppose, professional learning support that they would be offering to schools that have already done quite a lot of thinking and are quite far down this journey and then the kind of different sorts of approaches they would offer schools that are just starting out. Their emphasis was very much on this peer-to-peer sharing and support, so people aren't just going off in isolation. The other thing that will also help in that process will be the national network. So, there'll continue to be a focus for each area of learning and experience, bringing together the professional learning and the ongoing curriculum development, bringing together practitioners and experts and colleagues across the middle tier to give a bit of strategic direction and to be able to identify if there are areas where more support is needed. So, I think that a huge amount of thinking, particularly in the regions, has gone on into the practical support that can be given to schools, not just in engaging with the curriculum now, but then how they take it and think about then developing it in their schools. It feels like\u2014I think Graham Donaldson was calling it a 'slow-burn process'. You don't start in 2022\u2014people are already doing it and there's a lot of thought going into how to support continued sharing through the next two years. </s> Kirsty Williams AM : And I think that's another difference, you see\u2014that strong middle tier and the role that the middle tier is playing in Wales, which was absent in Scotland. So, this ability to work in networks to provide support to a network of schools, that wasn't available in the Scottish system and I think that makes\u2014I think that helps us in the way that they just simply didn't have a structure that allowed them to do that. It's not a criticism of them; it's just that we have got a structure that we can utilise to do that support so that schools are not completely left on their own and they can be working with other schools, with their regional consortia, going forward. </s> Suzy Davies AM : Can I just have a quick\u2014? </s> Lynne Neagle AM : Very quickly, because I want to move on to implementation. </s> Suzy Davies AM : Yes, sorry, I completely understand. Was one of the things that Scotland did\u2014I don't want to use the word 'assess'\u2014to monitor the pupil response to the curriculum as one of the means of deciding whether curricula in particular schools were working well enough? </s> Kirsty Williams AM : I don't know if they\u2014. I don't know if they did, but one of the interesting things that we were reflecting on over the weekend is that, certainly some of the Canadian systems, in particular, which we were interested in, used pupil surveys as part of their accountability regime\u2014so, actually taking the time to ask students how they felt, not just about the content of the new curriculum, but actually how they felt their school was doing. And so we're interested in looking, as I said, at some of the practices that other countries use to include pupil voice to find out what's happening. </s> Suzy Davies AM : Okay, that's interesting. Okay, thank you. </s> Kirsty Williams AM : Yes. I mean, it's early thoughts, because we've only just heard about it ourselves. But that's the beauty of working with other countries. They found that particular useful and successful, and we're keen to see if we could do something similar.",

    "article": "Lynne Neagle AM : Okay, thank you very much. We've got some questions now on potential unintended consequences, and other matters relating to that, from Hefin David. </s> Hefin David AM : Can I ask what value you place on the work done by the Wales Institute of Social and Economic Research, Data and Methods and the presentation so far and the paper to be presented by Dr Nigel Newton? </s> Kirsty Williams AM : I always\u2014and Welsh Government are big supporters of WISERD and the work that they do, and, in fact, we need more research into Welsh education, not less. Therefore, I find their papers really helpful and help us to inform our work. I think what's really important in perhaps this piece of work is to say that I hope that, in the time where I've had an influence to influence over Welsh education, either as a backbencher or now as a Minister, equality and principles of equity have always driven what I've tried to achieve. And I would never undertake a policy reform that I thought would lead to less equity in the Welsh education system. Closing the attainment gap is a core element of the national mission for education in Wales and we would not proceed with anything that we thought could lead to an exacerbation of an achievement gap. </s> Hefin David AM : Okay. And how do you respond, then\u2014? I mean, it's a balanced paper, it looks at pros and cons and there's a mixed picture from it. How do you respond to the specific statement that Dr Nigel Newton said that the curriculum could exacerbate segregation within schools between different groups of pupils? </s> Kirsty Williams AM : Well, I think what the paper acknowledges is that there is no evidence that that will happen. These are 'coulds' and 'maybes' and things that we need, as a Government, to take into consideration as we plan this journey. There can't be any empirical research done at the moment because the curriculum isn't being delivered, but I understand, and we need listen to\u2014. If there are concerns out there in the field that these are unintended consequences that we may fall into\u2014that is the value of that piece of research that helps inform us. I have to say, though, the curriculum in itself is neither going to necessarily on its own hugely enhance equity nor detract from equity, in the sense that the curriculum is what's taught in our schools. There is an opportunity, I believe, that empowering teachers to be able to be more flexible in what they teach their children actually gives us an opportunity to deliver lessons that could be much more engaging and much more relevant to some of our schoolchildren than what they have at the moment. What will make the curriculum a success for all of our children, and I believe will have a bigger impact on children who are in danger of being left behind, are the four enabling purposes of the curriculum. So, the curriculum on its own can play a part, but it will only be as good as the four enabling elements that surround it. And that is strong leadership of our schools that ensures that there is no segregation, that has high expectation of all of our children, and delivers a curriculum within that setting that meets the needs of the children there. Secondly: excellent teaching. In the end, no education system, whatever its curriculum, can exceed the quality of the people who stand in front of our children day in, day out. So, the curriculum can be the most exciting, wonderful\u2014and I think it is exciting and I think it's wonderful\u2014it can be the most exciting, wonderful thing in the world, but if teachers can't teach it effectively, if their pedagogy is not excellent, then the content itself\u2014it won't work. Then we've got issues around assessment and accountability. So, how do you assess how children are doing in your new curriculum? How do you understand how that pupil, who has, you know\u2014who could be vulnerable for a whole host of reasons, usually reasons outside of the school\u2014? That pupil is vulnerable. How can you assess how that pupil is and move their learning along in an appropriate fashion? And then, finally, the well-being of the child. People sometimes say, 'Oh, you're going soft\u2014typical, going soft'. But what we know is that we cannot expect children to learn unless we address issues around their well-being. But we also know that poor achievement is also detrimental to a child's well-being. There's been lots and lots of research done, not in a Welsh context but in other systems, where children are kept behind for a year. That has a massive impact on their well-being. So, good achievement leads to good well-being, but good well-being also leads to good achievement, and you can't separate the two. So, the curriculum on its own will not be enough. It is the four enabling objectives that sit around it, and we have to be cognisant of the WISERD's research, of course we do, to ensure that, as we're doing our professional learning, as we're planning well-being for our children, as we think about assessment methods and how we develop a culture of strong leaders in our schools\u2014and we have some, we have many, but we need to do more to support them\u2014it is that that will make the biggest difference, not just the content of the curriculum on its own. Although I do believe the flexibility that we're allowing people will, I think, lead to a curriculum and more meaningful lessons for some children in schools who are in danger of disengaging because they don't understand why they're being asked to learn what they're learning, they don't see the relevance of what they're learning to what they may want to do or how their lives are, or they don't see themselves reflected. So, for some of our communities, they don't see themselves reflected in the curriculum that we're teaching at the moment. And, again, international research would suggest that, if you want a child to thrive, they have to see themselves and their community reflected in what they're learning in schools. </s> Hefin David AM : What the WISERD research suggests is that the senior management teams\u2014the management teams\u2014would certainly buy into what you've just said, but the classroom teachers would be a little bit more sceptical. </s> Kirsty Williams AM : As I said, classroom teachers are absolutely crucial to this, which is why, first of all, we've taken the difficult step to delay the implementation of the curriculum to give us the time that we need to make sure that it's not just school leaders but it is individual classroom practitioners who have the skills that they need to make the most of the opportunity that the curriculum allows them. </s> Hefin David AM : So, if we look at some of the statements that were in the presentation by WISERD at the seminar two comments jump out: 'We'll end up'\u2014this is from classroom teachers\u2014 'We'll end up with a different accountability framework to the aims and objectives of the new curriculum.' and 'there will be no consistency'. And consistency is the one I'd particularly like to focus on: 'there will be no consistency across all schools in how the new curriculum is delivered which could affect outcomes'. </s> Kirsty Williams AM : Well, first of all, we've just talked, haven't we, about trying to ensure that there is greater consistency and that's why we're changing our approach to the legislation around the Bill. So, in terms of progression steps, there will be a statutory framework to ensure that progression is the same wherever you are in Wales. So, as I said, we're using this report, we're using this feedback, to inform decisions going forward. In terms of\u2014. Read the first bit again. Was it\u2014[Interruption.] Accountability, yes. </s> Hefin David AM : Yes: 'different accountability framework to the aims and objectives of the new curriculum.' </s> Kirsty Williams AM : Okay. So, as always, in education, teachers\u2014understandably, because this is the regime that they have been a part of\u2014immediately don't think about their pedagogy, they think about, 'How are judgments going to be made upon me as an individual?' And what we're trying to do is ensure that we are developing another accountability regime that is indeed in line with the purposes of the curriculum and doesn't work against the purposes of the curriculum. So, I understand why teachers are concerned. They spend a lot of time thinking about accountability and how they're going to be held accountable for their practice, but, again, what we want to do is provide reassurance that we are devising an accountability regime for our system that is in line with the purposes of the curriculum and puts us in line with the mainstream thought and reform process across the world of progressive education systems. </s> Hefin David AM : It was the segregation bit I was particularly interested in and the response with regard to disadvantaged pupils and pupils of lower attainment. </s> Kirsty Williams AM : I don't\u2014. I do not believe that any changes\u2014and I would not pursue any changes that\u2014would lead to a segregation. </s> Hefin David AM : Okay. And with regard to the connection between Welsh Government and local government and the concerns that the Welsh Local Government Association and the Association of Directors of Education Wales raised, what progress\u00a0has been made on bridging the gap between\u2014? Whether it's a perception gap or a practice gap, what progress has been made on that? </s> Kirsty Williams AM : Well, I think the last time we had this conversation in the committee I said that I think the comments that the WLGA and ADEW had made were reflective of an old piece of work and were not current and up to date, and I think progress had been made in that time, and I'm pleased to report the significant progress that's been made\u2014 </s> Hefin David AM : Bridges have been built. </s> Kirsty Williams AM : Bridges have been\u2014.

I have to say, though, the curriculum in itself is neither going to necessarily on its own hugely enhance equity nor detract from equity, in the sense that the curriculum is what's taught in our schools. There is an opportunity, I believe, that empowering teachers to be able to be more flexible in what they teach their children actually gives us an opportunity to deliver lessons that could be much more engaging and much more relevant to some of our schoolchildren than what they have at the moment. What will make the curriculum a success for all of our children, and I believe will have a bigger impact on children who are in danger of being left behind, are the four enabling purposes of the curriculum. So, the curriculum on its own can play a part, but it will only be as good as the four enabling elements that surround it. And that is strong leadership of our schools that ensures that there is no segregation, that has high expectation of all of our children, and delivers a curriculum within that setting that meets the needs of the children there. Secondly: excellent teaching. In the end, no education system, whatever its curriculum, can exceed the quality of the people who stand in front of our children day in, day out. So, the curriculum can be the most exciting, wonderful\u2014and I think it is exciting and I think it's wonderful\u2014it can be the most exciting, wonderful thing in the world, but if teachers can't teach it effectively, if their pedagogy is not excellent, then the content itself\u2014it won't work. Then we've got issues around assessment and accountability. So, how do you assess how children are doing in your new curriculum? How do you understand how that pupil, who has, you know\u2014who could be vulnerable for a whole host of reasons, usually reasons outside of the school\u2014? That pupil is vulnerable. How can you assess how that pupil is and move their learning along in an appropriate fashion? And then, finally, the well-being of the child. People sometimes say, 'Oh, you're going soft\u2014typical, going soft'. But what we know is that we cannot expect children to learn unless we address issues around their well-being. But we also know that poor achievement is also detrimental to a child's well-being. There's been lots and lots of research done, not in a Welsh context but in other systems, where children are kept behind for a year. That has a massive impact on their well-being. So, good achievement leads to good well-being, but good well-being also leads to good achievement, and you can't separate the two. So, the curriculum on its own will not be enough. It is the four enabling objectives that sit around it, and we have to be cognisant of the WISERD's research, of course we do, to ensure that, as we're doing our professional learning, as we're planning well-being for our children, as we think about assessment methods and how we develop a culture of strong leaders in our schools\u2014and we have some, we have many, but we need to do more to support them\u2014it is that that will make the biggest difference, not just the content of the curriculum on its own. Although I do believe the flexibility that we're allowing people will, I think, lead to a curriculum and more meaningful lessons for some children in schools who are in danger of disengaging because they don't understand why they're being asked to learn what they're learning, they don't see the relevance of what they're learning to what they may want to do or how their lives are, or they don't see themselves reflected. So, for some of our communities, they don't see themselves reflected in the curriculum that we're teaching at the moment. And, again, international research would suggest that, if you want a child to thrive, they have to see themselves and their community reflected in what they're learning in schools. </s> Hefin David AM : What the WISERD research suggests is that the senior management teams\u2014the management teams\u2014would certainly buy into what you've just said, but the classroom teachers would be a little bit more sceptical. </s> Kirsty Williams AM : As I said, classroom teachers are absolutely crucial to this, which is why, first of all, we've taken the difficult step to delay the implementation of the curriculum to give us the time that we need to make sure that it's not just school leaders but it is individual classroom practitioners who have the skills that they need to make the most of the opportunity that the curriculum allows them. </s> Hefin David AM : So, if we look at some of the statements that were in the presentation by WISERD at the seminar two comments jump out: 'We'll end up'\u2014this is from classroom teachers\u2014 'We'll end up with a different accountability framework to the aims and objectives of the new curriculum.' and 'there will be no consistency'. And consistency is the one I'd particularly like to focus on: 'there will be no consistency across all schools in how the new curriculum is delivered which could affect outcomes'. </s> Kirsty Williams AM : Well, first of all, we've just talked, haven't we, about trying to ensure that there is greater consistency and that's why we're changing our approach to the legislation around the Bill. So, in terms of progression steps, there will be a statutory framework to ensure that progression is the same wherever you are in Wales. So, as I said, we're using this report, we're using this feedback, to inform decisions going forward. In terms of\u2014. Read the first bit again. Was it\u2014[Interruption.] Accountability, yes. </s> Hefin David AM : Yes: 'different accountability framework to the aims and objectives of the new curriculum.' </s> Kirsty Williams AM : Okay. So, as always, in education, teachers\u2014understandably, because this is the regime that they have been a part of\u2014immediately don't think about their pedagogy, they think about, 'How are judgments going to be made upon me as an individual?' And what we're trying to do is ensure that we are developing another accountability regime that is indeed in line with the purposes of the curriculum and doesn't work against the purposes of the curriculum. So, I understand why teachers are concerned. They spend a lot of time thinking about accountability and how they're going to be held accountable for their practice, but, again, what we want to do is provide reassurance that we are devising an accountability regime for our system that is in line with the purposes of the curriculum and puts us in line with the mainstream thought and reform process across the world of progressive education systems. </s> Hefin David AM : It was the segregation bit I was particularly interested in and the response with regard to disadvantaged pupils and pupils of lower attainment. </s> Kirsty Williams AM : I don't\u2014. I do not believe that any changes\u2014and I would not pursue any changes that\u2014would lead to a segregation. </s> Hefin David AM : Okay. And with regard to the connection between Welsh Government and local government and the concerns that the Welsh Local Government Association and the Association of Directors of Education Wales raised, what progress\u00a0has been made on bridging the gap between\u2014? Whether it's a perception gap or a practice gap, what progress has been made on that? </s> Kirsty Williams AM : Well, I think the last time we had this conversation in the committee I said that I think the comments that the WLGA and ADEW had made were reflective of an old piece of work and were not current and up to date, and I think progress had been made in that time, and I'm pleased to report the significant progress that's been made\u2014 </s> Hefin David AM : Bridges have been built. </s> Kirsty Williams AM : Bridges have been\u2014. Well, from my perspective, the bridges were always there. But we've got renewed, energetic engagement from the WLGA and ADEW in all the arrangements that we have for the development of the curriculum and my understanding is that they have said publicly and in writing that they're very supportive of what's going on. </s> Hefin David AM : I'm sure they're watching and nodding vigorously now on Senedd.tv. </s> Kirsty Williams AM : And I will be with them tomorrow night and Friday morning and I'm sure if they've got any other views they'll let me know. </s> Hefin David AM : And the final question: there is a process, a model for this, which is Scotland. What kind of lessons are being learned from the introduction of their curriculum? </s> Kirsty Williams AM : Okay. So, I think the first thing to realise is that our curriculum is not a copycat of the Scottish curriculum, but it is always useful to reflect on how other systems have undertaken curriculum reform in their nation and to learn from any issues that have arisen. So, I think it's fair to say\u2014and I spent time with some delegates from Scotland just this weekend at the Atlantic Rim Collaboratory conference that Wales hosted this year. Unfortunately, Minister Swinney was not able to attend at the very last minute because of Brexit preparedness work that he was involved in, but certainly their teaching union and their equivalent of the EWC in Scotland joined us as well as representatives from the Scottish Government, although not John himself, and they were very frank about some of the challenges that they had faced in introducing their curriculum. Part of that is about assessment and they had not really thought\u2014. They spent all their time thinking about content and spent no time at all thinking about assessment. Assessment has been a crucial part of the process that we have been involved in. Professional learning, ensuring that the profession was properly prepared for the changes, I think they would agree that that wasn't necessarily\u2014. The middle tier, which they don't have to the\u2014. Well, they've got local authorities and regions, but whether they were truly engaged in what they were doing. So, I think we've learned\u2014. Although our curriculum isn't a copycat, as I said, we have been able to learn from, and we've had people who have been deeply involved in the Scottish experience as part of some of our curriculum and assessment groups and some of the advice that we've had in terms of developing coherence. But, Steve, I don't know if\u2014. You speak to your Scottish colleagues quite a lot. </s> Steve Davies : As I said, they're very forthright in sharing their learning and I think one of the critical elements was the extent to which assessment was considered at the outset alongside the curriculum content. So, that was critical, but we've embraced experts who were involved in that process who were part of our curriculum assessment group. So, they feed in throughout\u2014not 'don't do this because Scotland has done it', but they feed some of that learning into the system. As the Minister said, we had seven other countries from across the world giving us feedback and input over four days as to where we can continue to look at what we're doing but also checks and balances against some of their experiences with this area of reform. </s> Kirsty Williams AM : The particular focus of this year's conference was on the issue of assessment and we were joined by colleagues from Scotland, from Ireland, from Iceland, from Finland, from Saskatchewan, from Nova Scotia and from Uruguay. </s> Hefin David AM : When did that take place? </s> Kirsty Williams AM : Where? </s> Hefin David AM : When. </s> Kirsty Williams AM : The weekend just gone. </s> Hefin David AM : Right. </s> Lynne Neagle AM : Okay, thank you. Suzy. You've got a whole section on assessment, I don't know\u2014 </s> Suzy Davies AM : This isn't about assessment. </s> Lynne Neagle AM : Oh, okay. Go on, then. </s> Suzy Davies AM : So, on the basis that this is not about assessment, you mentioned that one of the lessons learned from Scotland is that they said they spent too much time on curriculum content rather than assessment. Can you tell me a little bit about what you've learned about how they quality control the content, even though the content, of course, will be completely different in Wales? </s> Kirsty Williams AM : Yes, the content would be completely different. When I said they spent too much time, I said that the focus had been in their work about just talking about content and, actually, the assessment arrangements were bolted on at the end of the process. So, the curriculum was all designed and developed, it was sent out to schools, and then the question was raised: 'Oh, actually, what assessment methods\u2014? How are going to assess how children are getting on?' But, Steve, you would have more details of their exact experience of quality control of the content\u2014 </s> Suzy Davies AM : Of the content, because every school is going to be very different at this. </s> Steve Davies : In terms of developing the guidance and the curriculum going out in January is concerned, I think\u2014again, I don't want to be overly critical, but one of the findings was that they encouraged schools to go forth and multiply in terms of the materials and ideas and concepts that were coming through. What we learnt was to actually\u2014the pioneer movement was to get a smaller group to develop those materials and look to engage through cluster groups. So, we had pioneers who worked with clusters to test the development of that concept before we were looking for schools to go away and develop a larger amount of content. So, in terms of the staging and measuring of bringing together the curriculum and the associated guidance, I think the time we've taken to actually get there and the strategy of using pioneer schools, external experts, back to pioneer schools, back to regions, or engaging regions in that, has been more measured and planned against a planned timescale, where everyone from the outset\u2014with the exception of the extension of the one year\u2014was clear on when we were going to be producing materials that would allow the profession to then take it and use it. I think\u2014. Claire, do you want to add to that, or\u2014? </s> Claire Bennett : I think, as we move forward, that kind of cluster approach remains really important. So, it's, as schools then think about, 'What am I going to do in my school?', that they're doing that in clusters together. When colleagues from the regional consortia were sharing their thinking with the curriculum assessment group last week, they were talking about the very specific and differentiated, I suppose, professional learning support that they would be offering to schools that have already done quite a lot of thinking and are quite far down this journey and then the kind of different sorts of approaches they would offer schools that are just starting out. Their emphasis was very much on this peer-to-peer sharing and support, so people aren't just going off in isolation. The other thing that will also help in that process will be the national network. So, there'll continue to be a focus for each area of learning and experience, bringing together the professional learning and the ongoing curriculum development, bringing together practitioners and experts and colleagues across the middle tier to give a bit of strategic direction and to be able to identify if there are areas where more support is needed. So, I think that a huge amount of thinking, particularly in the regions, has gone on into the practical support that can be given to schools, not just in engaging with the curriculum now, but then how they take it and think about then developing it in their schools. It feels like\u2014I think Graham Donaldson was calling it a 'slow-burn process'. You don't start in 2022\u2014people are already doing it and there's a lot of thought going into how to support continued sharing through the next two years. </s> Kirsty Williams AM : And I think that's another difference, you see\u2014that strong middle tier and the role that the middle tier is playing in Wales, which was absent in Scotland. So, this ability to work in networks to provide support to a network of schools, that wasn't available in the Scottish system and I think that makes\u2014I think that helps us in the way that they just simply didn't have a structure that allowed them to do that. It's not a criticism of them; it's just that we have got a structure that we can utilise to do that support so that schools are not completely left on their own and they can be working with other schools, with their regional consortia, going forward. </s> Suzy Davies AM : Can I just have a quick\u2014? </s> Lynne Neagle AM : Very quickly, because I want to move on to implementation. </s> Suzy Davies AM : Yes, sorry, I completely understand. Was one of the things that Scotland did\u2014I don't want to use the word 'assess'\u2014to monitor the pupil response to the curriculum as one of the means of deciding whether curricula in particular schools were working well enough? </s> Kirsty Williams AM : I don't know if they\u2014. I don't know if they did, but one of the interesting things that we were reflecting on over the weekend is that, certainly some of the Canadian systems, in particular, which we were interested in, used pupil surveys as part of their accountability regime\u2014so, actually taking the time to ask students how they felt, not just about the content of the new curriculum, but actually how they felt their school was doing. And so we're interested in looking, as I said, at some of the practices that other countries use to include pupil voice to find out what's happening. </s> Suzy Davies AM : Okay, that's interesting. Okay, thank you. </s> Kirsty Williams AM : Yes. I mean, it's early thoughts, because we've only just heard about it ourselves. But that's the beauty of working with other countries. They found that particular useful and successful, and we're keen to see if we could do something similar.",

    "article": "Lynne Neagle AM : Okay, thank you very much. We've got some questions now on potential unintended consequences, and other matters relating to that, from Hefin David. </s> Hefin David AM : Can I ask what value you place on the work done by the Wales Institute of Social and Economic Research, Data and Methods and the presentation so far and the paper to be presented by Dr Nigel Newton? </s> Kirsty Williams AM : I always\u2014and Welsh Government are big supporters of WISERD and the work that they do, and, in fact, we need more research into Welsh education, not less. Therefore, I find their papers really helpful and help us to inform our work. I think what's really important in perhaps this piece of work is to say that I hope that, in the time where I've had an influence to influence over Welsh education, either as a backbencher or now as a Minister, equality and principles of equity have always driven what I've tried to achieve. And I would never undertake a policy reform that I thought would lead to less equity in the Welsh education system. Closing the attainment gap is a core element of the national mission for education in Wales and we would not proceed with anything that we thought could lead to an exacerbation of an achievement gap. </s> Hefin David AM : Okay. And how do you respond, then\u2014? I mean, it's a balanced paper, it looks at pros and cons and there's a mixed picture from it. How do you respond to the specific statement that Dr Nigel Newton said that the curriculum could exacerbate segregation within schools between different groups of pupils? </s> Kirsty Williams AM : Well, I think what the paper acknowledges is that there is no evidence that that will happen. These are 'coulds' and 'maybes' and things that we need, as a Government, to take into consideration as we plan this journey. There can't be any empirical research done at the moment because the curriculum isn't being delivered, but I understand, and we need listen to\u2014. If there are concerns out there in the field that these are unintended consequences that we may fall into\u2014that is the value of that piece of research that helps inform us.

So, in terms of the staging and measuring of bringing together the curriculum and the associated guidance, I think the time we've taken to actually get there and the strategy of using pioneer schools, external experts, back to pioneer schools, back to regions, or engaging regions in that, has been more measured and planned against a planned timescale, where everyone from the outset\u2014with the exception of the extension of the one year\u2014was clear on when we were going to be producing materials that would allow the profession to then take it and use it. I think\u2014. Claire, do you want to add to that, or\u2014? </s> Claire Bennett : I think, as we move forward, that kind of cluster approach remains really important. So, it's, as schools then think about, 'What am I going to do in my school?', that they're doing that in clusters together. When colleagues from the regional consortia were sharing their thinking with the curriculum assessment group last week, they were talking about the very specific and differentiated, I suppose, professional learning support that they would be offering to schools that have already done quite a lot of thinking and are quite far down this journey and then the kind of different sorts of approaches they would offer schools that are just starting out. Their emphasis was very much on this peer-to-peer sharing and support, so people aren't just going off in isolation. The other thing that will also help in that process will be the national network. So, there'll continue to be a focus for each area of learning and experience, bringing together the professional learning and the ongoing curriculum development, bringing together practitioners and experts and colleagues across the middle tier to give a bit of strategic direction and to be able to identify if there are areas where more support is needed. So, I think that a huge amount of thinking, particularly in the regions, has gone on into the practical support that can be given to schools, not just in engaging with the curriculum now, but then how they take it and think about then developing it in their schools. It feels like\u2014I think Graham Donaldson was calling it a 'slow-burn process'. You don't start in 2022\u2014people are already doing it and there's a lot of thought going into how to support continued sharing through the next two years. </s> Kirsty Williams AM : And I think that's another difference, you see\u2014that strong middle tier and the role that the middle tier is playing in Wales, which was absent in Scotland. So, this ability to work in networks to provide support to a network of schools, that wasn't available in the Scottish system and I think that makes\u2014I think that helps us in the way that they just simply didn't have a structure that allowed them to do that. It's not a criticism of them; it's just that we have got a structure that we can utilise to do that support so that schools are not completely left on their own and they can be working with other schools, with their regional consortia, going forward. </s> Suzy Davies AM : Can I just have a quick\u2014? </s> Lynne Neagle AM : Very quickly, because I want to move on to implementation. </s> Suzy Davies AM : Yes, sorry, I completely understand. Was one of the things that Scotland did\u2014I don't want to use the word 'assess'\u2014to monitor the pupil response to the curriculum as one of the means of deciding whether curricula in particular schools were working well enough? </s> Kirsty Williams AM : I don't know if they\u2014. I don't know if they did, but one of the interesting things that we were reflecting on over the weekend is that, certainly some of the Canadian systems, in particular, which we were interested in, used pupil surveys as part of their accountability regime\u2014so, actually taking the time to ask students how they felt, not just about the content of the new curriculum, but actually how they felt their school was doing. And so we're interested in looking, as I said, at some of the practices that other countries use to include pupil voice to find out what's happening. </s> Suzy Davies AM : Okay, that's interesting. Okay, thank you. </s> Kirsty Williams AM : Yes. I mean, it's early thoughts, because we've only just heard about it ourselves. But that's the beauty of working with other countries. They found that particular useful and successful, and we're keen to see if we could do something similar.",

    "article": "Lynne Neagle AM : Okay, thank you very much. We've got some questions now on potential unintended consequences, and other matters relating to that, from Hefin David. </s> Hefin David AM : Can I ask what value you place on the work done by the Wales Institute of Social and Economic Research, Data and Methods and the presentation so far and the paper to be presented by Dr Nigel Newton? </s> Kirsty Williams AM : I always\u2014and Welsh Government are big supporters of WISERD and the work that they do, and, in fact, we need more research into Welsh education, not less. Therefore, I find their papers really helpful and help us to inform our work. I think what's really important in perhaps this piece of work is to say that I hope that, in the time where I've had an influence to influence over Welsh education, either as a backbencher or now as a Minister, equality and principles of equity have always driven what I've tried to achieve. And I would never undertake a policy reform that I thought would lead to less equity in the Welsh education system. Closing the attainment gap is a core element of the national mission for education in Wales and we would not proceed with anything that we thought could lead to an exacerbation of an achievement gap. </s> Hefin David AM : Okay. And how do you respond, then\u2014? I mean, it's a balanced paper, it looks at pros and cons and there's a mixed picture from it. How do you respond to the specific statement that Dr Nigel Newton said that the curriculum could exacerbate segregation within schools between different groups of pupils? </s> Kirsty Williams AM : Well, I think what the paper acknowledges is that there is no evidence that that will happen. These are 'coulds' and 'maybes' and things that we need, as a Government, to take into consideration as we plan this journey. There can't be any empirical research done at the moment because the curriculum isn't being delivered, but I understand, and we need listen to\u2014. If there are concerns out there in the field that these are unintended consequences that we may fall into\u2014that is the value of that piece of research that helps inform us. I have to say, though, the curriculum in itself is neither going to necessarily on its own hugely enhance equity nor detract from equity, in the sense that the curriculum is what's taught in our schools. There is an opportunity, I believe, that empowering teachers to be able to be more flexible in what they teach their children actually gives us an opportunity to deliver lessons that could be much more engaging and much more relevant to some of our schoolchildren than what they have at the moment. What will make the curriculum a success for all of our children, and I believe will have a bigger impact on children who are in danger of being left behind, are the four enabling purposes of the curriculum. So, the curriculum on its own can play a part, but it will only be as good as the four enabling elements that surround it. And that is strong leadership of our schools that ensures that there is no segregation, that has high expectation of all of our children, and delivers a curriculum within that setting that meets the needs of the children there. Secondly: excellent teaching. In the end, no education system, whatever its curriculum, can exceed the quality of the people who stand in front of our children day in, day out. So, the curriculum can be the most exciting, wonderful\u2014and I think it is exciting and I think it's wonderful\u2014it can be the most exciting, wonderful thing in the world, but if teachers can't teach it effectively, if their pedagogy is not excellent, then the content itself\u2014it won't work. Then we've got issues around assessment and accountability. So, how do you assess how children are doing in your new curriculum? How do you understand how that pupil, who has, you know\u2014who could be vulnerable for a whole host of reasons, usually reasons outside of the school\u2014? That pupil is vulnerable. How can you assess how that pupil is and move their learning along in an appropriate fashion? And then, finally, the well-being of the child. People sometimes say, 'Oh, you're going soft\u2014typical, going soft'. But what we know is that we cannot expect children to learn unless we address issues around their well-being. But we also know that poor achievement is also detrimental to a child's well-being. There's been lots and lots of research done, not in a Welsh context but in other systems, where children are kept behind for a year. That has a massive impact on their well-being. So, good achievement leads to good well-being, but good well-being also leads to good achievement, and you can't separate the two. So, the curriculum on its own will not be enough. It is the four enabling objectives that sit around it, and we have to be cognisant of the WISERD's research, of course we do, to ensure that, as we're doing our professional learning, as we're planning well-being for our children, as we think about assessment methods and how we develop a culture of strong leaders in our schools\u2014and we have some, we have many, but we need to do more to support them\u2014it is that that will make the biggest difference, not just the content of the curriculum on its own. Although I do believe the flexibility that we're allowing people will, I think, lead to a curriculum and more meaningful lessons for some children in schools who are in danger of disengaging because they don't understand why they're being asked to learn what they're learning, they don't see the relevance of what they're learning to what they may want to do or how their lives are, or they don't see themselves reflected. So, for some of our communities, they don't see themselves reflected in the curriculum that we're teaching at the moment. And, again, international research would suggest that, if you want a child to thrive, they have to see themselves and their community reflected in what they're learning in schools. </s> Hefin David AM : What the WISERD research suggests is that the senior management teams\u2014the management teams\u2014would certainly buy into what you've just said, but the classroom teachers would be a little bit more sceptical. </s> Kirsty Williams AM : As I said, classroom teachers are absolutely crucial to this, which is why, first of all, we've taken the difficult step to delay the implementation of the curriculum to give us the time that we need to make sure that it's not just school leaders but it is individual classroom practitioners who have the skills that they need to make the most of the opportunity that the curriculum allows them. </s> Hefin David AM : So, if we look at some of the statements that were in the presentation by WISERD at the seminar two comments jump out: 'We'll end up'\u2014this is from classroom teachers\u2014 'We'll end up with a different accountability framework to the aims and objectives of the new curriculum.' and 'there will be no consistency'. And consistency is the one I'd particularly like to focus on: 'there will be no consistency across all schools in how the new curriculum is delivered which could affect outcomes'. </s> Kirsty Williams AM : Well, first of all, we've just talked, haven't we, about trying to ensure that there is greater consistency and that's why we're changing our approach to the legislation around the Bill. So, in terms of progression steps, there will be a statutory framework to ensure that progression is the same wherever you are in Wales. So, as I said, we're using this report, we're using this feedback, to inform decisions going forward. In terms of\u2014. Read the first bit again. Was it\u2014[Interruption.] Accountability, yes. </s> Hefin David AM : Yes: 'different accountability framework to the aims and objectives of the new curriculum.' </s> Kirsty Williams AM : Okay. So, as always, in education, teachers\u2014understandably, because this is the regime that they have been a part of\u2014immediately don't think about their pedagogy, they think about, 'How are judgments going to be made upon me as an individual?' And what we're trying to do is ensure that we are developing another accountability regime that is indeed in line with the purposes of the curriculum and doesn't work against the purposes of the curriculum. So, I understand why teachers are concerned. They spend a lot of time thinking about accountability and how they're going to be held accountable for their practice, but, again, what we want to do is provide reassurance that we are devising an accountability regime for our system that is in line with the purposes of the curriculum and puts us in line with the mainstream thought and reform process across the world of progressive education systems. </s> Hefin David AM : It was the segregation bit I was particularly interested in and the response with regard to disadvantaged pupils and pupils of lower attainment. </s> Kirsty Williams AM : I don't\u2014. I do not believe that any changes\u2014and I would not pursue any changes that\u2014would lead to a segregation. </s> Hefin David AM : Okay. And with regard to the connection between Welsh Government and local government and the concerns that the Welsh Local Government Association and the Association of Directors of Education Wales raised, what progress\u00a0has been made on bridging the gap between\u2014? Whether it's a perception gap or a practice gap, what progress has been made on that? </s> Kirsty Williams AM : Well, I think the last time we had this conversation in the committee I said that I think the comments that the WLGA and ADEW had made were reflective of an old piece of work and were not current and up to date, and I think progress had been made in that time, and I'm pleased to report the significant progress that's been made\u2014 </s> Hefin David AM : Bridges have been built. </s> Kirsty Williams AM : Bridges have been\u2014. Well, from my perspective, the bridges were always there. But we've got renewed, energetic engagement from the WLGA and ADEW in all the arrangements that we have for the development of the curriculum and my understanding is that they have said publicly and in writing that they're very supportive of what's going on. </s> Hefin David AM : I'm sure they're watching and nodding vigorously now on Senedd.tv. </s> Kirsty Williams AM : And I will be with them tomorrow night and Friday morning and I'm sure if they've got any other views they'll let me know. </s> Hefin David AM : And the final question: there is a process, a model for this, which is Scotland. What kind of lessons are being learned from the introduction of their curriculum? </s> Kirsty Williams AM : Okay. So, I think the first thing to realise is that our curriculum is not a copycat of the Scottish curriculum, but it is always useful to reflect on how other systems have undertaken curriculum reform in their nation and to learn from any issues that have arisen. So, I think it's fair to say\u2014and I spent time with some delegates from Scotland just this weekend at the Atlantic Rim Collaboratory conference that Wales hosted this year. Unfortunately, Minister Swinney was not able to attend at the very last minute because of Brexit preparedness work that he was involved in, but certainly their teaching union and their equivalent of the EWC in Scotland joined us as well as representatives from the Scottish Government, although not John himself, and they were very frank about some of the challenges that they had faced in introducing their curriculum. Part of that is about assessment and they had not really thought\u2014. They spent all their time thinking about content and spent no time at all thinking about assessment. Assessment has been a crucial part of the process that we have been involved in. Professional learning, ensuring that the profession was properly prepared for the changes, I think they would agree that that wasn't necessarily\u2014. The middle tier, which they don't have to the\u2014. Well, they've got local authorities and regions, but whether they were truly engaged in what they were doing. So, I think we've learned\u2014. Although our curriculum isn't a copycat, as I said, we have been able to learn from, and we've had people who have been deeply involved in the Scottish experience as part of some of our curriculum and assessment groups and some of the advice that we've had in terms of developing coherence. But, Steve, I don't know if\u2014. You speak to your Scottish colleagues quite a lot. </s> Steve Davies : As I said, they're very forthright in sharing their learning and I think one of the critical elements was the extent to which assessment was considered at the outset alongside the curriculum content. So, that was critical, but we've embraced experts who were involved in that process who were part of our curriculum assessment group. So, they feed in throughout\u2014not 'don't do this because Scotland has done it', but they feed some of that learning into the system. As the Minister said, we had seven other countries from across the world giving us feedback and input over four days as to where we can continue to look at what we're doing but also checks and balances against some of their experiences with this area of reform. </s> Kirsty Williams AM : The particular focus of this year's conference was on the issue of assessment and we were joined by colleagues from Scotland, from Ireland, from Iceland, from Finland, from Saskatchewan, from Nova Scotia and from Uruguay. </s> Hefin David AM : When did that take place? </s> Kirsty Williams AM : Where? </s> Hefin David AM : When. </s> Kirsty Williams AM : The weekend just gone. </s> Hefin David AM : Right. </s> Lynne Neagle AM : Okay, thank you. Suzy. You've got a whole section on assessment, I don't know\u2014 </s> Suzy Davies AM : This isn't about assessment. </s> Lynne Neagle AM : Oh, okay. Go on, then. </s> Suzy Davies AM : So, on the basis that this is not about assessment, you mentioned that one of the lessons learned from Scotland is that they said they spent too much time on curriculum content rather than assessment. Can you tell me a little bit about what you've learned about how they quality control the content, even though the content, of course, will be completely different in Wales? </s> Kirsty Williams AM : Yes, the content would be completely different. When I said they spent too much time, I said that the focus had been in their work about just talking about content and, actually, the assessment arrangements were bolted on at the end of the process. So, the curriculum was all designed and developed, it was sent out to schools, and then the question was raised: 'Oh, actually, what assessment methods\u2014? How are going to assess how children are getting on?' But, Steve, you would have more details of their exact experience of quality control of the content\u2014 </s> Suzy Davies AM : Of the content, because every school is going to be very different at this. </s> Steve Davies : In terms of developing the guidance and the curriculum going out in January is concerned, I think\u2014again, I don't want to be overly critical, but one of the findings was that they encouraged schools to go forth and multiply in terms of the materials and ideas and concepts that were coming through. What we learnt was to actually\u2014the pioneer movement was to get a smaller group to develop those materials and look to engage through cluster groups. So, we had pioneers who worked with clusters to test the development of that concept before we were looking for schools to go away and develop a larger amount of content. So, in terms of the staging and measuring of bringing together the curriculum and the associated guidance, I think the time we've taken to actually get there and the strategy of using pioneer schools, external experts, back to pioneer schools, back to regions, or engaging regions in that, has been more measured and planned against a planned timescale, where everyone from the outset\u2014with the exception of the extension of the one year\u2014was clear on when we were going to be producing materials that would allow the profession to then take it and use it. I think\u2014. Claire, do you want to add to that, or\u2014? </s> Claire Bennett : I think, as we move forward, that kind of cluster approach remains really important. So, it's, as schools then think about, 'What am I going to do in my school?', that they're doing that in clusters together. When colleagues from the regional consortia were sharing their thinking with the curriculum assessment group last week, they were talking about the very specific and differentiated, I suppose, professional learning support that they would be offering to schools that have already done quite a lot of thinking and are quite far down this journey and then the kind of different sorts of approaches they would offer schools that are just starting out. Their emphasis was very much on this peer-to-peer sharing and support, so people aren't just going off in isolation. The other thing that will also help in that process will be the national network. So, there'll continue to be a focus for each area of learning and experience, bringing together the professional learning and the ongoing curriculum development, bringing together practitioners and experts and colleagues across the middle tier to give a bit of strategic direction and to be able to identify if there are areas where more support is needed. So, I think that a huge amount of thinking, particularly in the regions, has gone on into the practical support that can be given to schools, not just in engaging with the curriculum now, but then how they take it and think about then developing it in their schools.

Then we've got issues around assessment and accountability. So, how do you assess how children are doing in your new curriculum? How do you understand how that pupil, who has, you know\u2014who could be vulnerable for a whole host of reasons, usually reasons outside of the school\u2014? That pupil is vulnerable. How can you assess how that pupil is and move their learning along in an appropriate fashion? And then, finally, the well-being of the child. People sometimes say, 'Oh, you're going soft\u2014typical, going soft'. But what we know is that we cannot expect children to learn unless we address issues around their well-being. But we also know that poor achievement is also detrimental to a child's well-being. There's been lots and lots of research done, not in a Welsh context but in other systems, where children are kept behind for a year. That has a massive impact on their well-being. So, good achievement leads to good well-being, but good well-being also leads to good achievement, and you can't separate the two. So, the curriculum on its own will not be enough. It is the four enabling objectives that sit around it, and we have to be cognisant of the WISERD's research, of course we do, to ensure that, as we're doing our professional learning, as we're planning well-being for our children, as we think about assessment methods and how we develop a culture of strong leaders in our schools\u2014and we have some, we have many, but we need to do more to support them\u2014it is that that will make the biggest difference, not just the content of the curriculum on its own. Although I do believe the flexibility that we're allowing people will, I think, lead to a curriculum and more meaningful lessons for some children in schools who are in danger of disengaging because they don't understand why they're being asked to learn what they're learning, they don't see the relevance of what they're learning to what they may want to do or how their lives are, or they don't see themselves reflected. So, for some of our communities, they don't see themselves reflected in the curriculum that we're teaching at the moment. And, again, international research would suggest that, if you want a child to thrive, they have to see themselves and their community reflected in what they're learning in schools. </s> Hefin David AM : What the WISERD research suggests is that the senior management teams\u2014the management teams\u2014would certainly buy into what you've just said, but the classroom teachers would be a little bit more sceptical. </s> Kirsty Williams AM : As I said, classroom teachers are absolutely crucial to this, which is why, first of all, we've taken the difficult step to delay the implementation of the curriculum to give us the time that we need to make sure that it's not just school leaders but it is individual classroom practitioners who have the skills that they need to make the most of the opportunity that the curriculum allows them. </s> Hefin David AM : So, if we look at some of the statements that were in the presentation by WISERD at the seminar two comments jump out: 'We'll end up'\u2014this is from classroom teachers\u2014 'We'll end up with a different accountability framework to the aims and objectives of the new curriculum.' and 'there will be no consistency'.

So, as always, in education, teachers\u2014understandably, because this is the regime that they have been a part of\u2014immediately don't think about their pedagogy, they think about, 'How are judgments going to be made upon me as an individual?' And what we're trying to do is ensure that we are developing another accountability regime that is indeed in line with the purposes of the curriculum and doesn't work against the purposes of the curriculum. So, I understand why teachers are concerned. They spend a lot of time thinking about accountability and how they're going to be held accountable for their practice, but, again, what we want to do is provide reassurance that we are devising an accountability regime for our system that is in line with the purposes of the curriculum and puts us in line with the mainstream thought and reform process across the world of progressive education systems. </s> Hefin David AM : It was the segregation bit I was particularly interested in and the response with regard to disadvantaged pupils and pupils of lower attainment. </s> Kirsty Williams AM : I don't\u2014. I do not believe that any changes\u2014and I would not pursue any changes that\u2014would lead to a segregation. </s> Hefin David AM : Okay. And with regard to the connection between Welsh Government and local government and the concerns that the Welsh Local Government Association and the Association of Directors of Education Wales raised, what progress\u00a0has been made on bridging the gap between\u2014? Whether it's a perception gap or a practice gap, what progress has been made on that? </s> Kirsty Williams AM : Well, I think the last time we had this conversation in the committee I said that I think the comments that the WLGA and ADEW had made were reflective of an old piece of work and were not current and up to date, and I think progress had been made in that time, and I'm pleased to report the significant progress that's been made\u2014 </s> Hefin David AM : Bridges have been built. </s> Kirsty Williams AM : Bridges have been\u2014. Well, from my perspective, the bridges were always there. But we've got renewed, energetic engagement from the WLGA and ADEW in all the arrangements that we have for the development of the curriculum and my understanding is that they have said publicly and in writing that they're very supportive of what's going on. </s> Hefin David AM : I'm sure they're watching and nodding vigorously now on Senedd.tv. </s> Kirsty Williams AM : And I will be with them tomorrow night and Friday morning and I'm sure if they've got any other views they'll let me know. </s> Hefin David AM : And the final question: there is a process, a model for this, which is Scotland. What kind of lessons are being learned from the introduction of their curriculum? </s> Kirsty Williams AM : Okay. So, I think the first thing to realise is that our curriculum is not a copycat of the Scottish curriculum, but it is always useful to reflect on how other systems have undertaken curriculum reform in their nation and to learn from any issues that have arisen. So, I think it's fair to say\u2014and I spent time with some delegates from Scotland just this weekend at the Atlantic Rim Collaboratory conference that Wales hosted this year. Unfortunately, Minister Swinney was not able to attend at the very last minute because of Brexit preparedness work that he was involved in, but certainly their teaching union and their equivalent of the EWC in Scotland joined us as well as representatives from the Scottish Government, although not John himself, and they were very frank about some of the challenges that they had faced in introducing their curriculum. Part of that is about assessment and they had not really thought\u2014. They spent all their time thinking about content and spent no time at all thinking about assessment. Assessment has been a crucial part of the process that we have been involved in. Professional learning, ensuring that the profession was properly prepared for the changes, I think they would agree that that wasn't necessarily\u2014. The middle tier, which they don't have to the\u2014. Well, they've got local authorities and regions, but whether they were truly engaged in what they were doing. So, I think we've learned\u2014. Although our curriculum isn't a copycat, as I said, we have been able to learn from, and we've had people who have been deeply involved in the Scottish experience as part of some of our curriculum and assessment groups and some of the advice that we've had in terms of developing coherence. But, Steve, I don't know if\u2014. You speak to your Scottish colleagues quite a lot. </s> Steve Davies : As I said, they're very forthright in sharing their learning and I think one of the critical elements was the extent to which assessment was considered at the outset alongside the curriculum content. So, that was critical, but we've embraced experts who were involved in that process who were part of our curriculum assessment group. So, they feed in throughout\u2014not 'don't do this because Scotland has done it', but they feed some of that learning into the system. As the Minister said, we had seven other countries from across the world giving us feedback and input over four days as to where we can continue to look at what we're doing but also checks and balances against some of their experiences with this area of reform. </s> Kirsty Williams AM : The particular focus of this year's conference was on the issue of assessment and we were joined by colleagues from Scotland, from Ireland, from Iceland, from Finland, from Saskatchewan, from Nova Scotia and from Uruguay. </s> Hefin David AM : When did that take place? </s> Kirsty Williams AM : Where? </s> Hefin David AM : When. </s> Kirsty Williams AM : The weekend just gone. </s> Hefin David AM : Right. </s> Lynne Neagle AM : Okay, thank you. Suzy. You've got a whole section on assessment, I don't know\u2014 </s> Suzy Davies AM : This isn't about assessment. </s> Lynne Neagle AM : Oh, okay. Go on, then. </s> Suzy Davies AM : So, on the basis that this is not about assessment, you mentioned that one of the lessons learned from Scotland is that they said they spent too much time on curriculum content rather than assessment. Can you tell me a little bit about what you've learned about how they quality control the content, even though the content, of course, will be completely different in Wales? </s> Kirsty Williams AM : Yes, the content would be completely different. When I said they spent too much time, I said that the focus had been in their work about just talking about content and, actually, the assessment arrangements were bolted on at the end of the process. So, the curriculum was all designed and developed, it was sent out to schools, and then the question was raised: 'Oh, actually, what assessment methods\u2014? How are going to assess how children are getting on?' But, Steve, you would have more details of their exact experience of quality control of the content\u2014 </s> Suzy Davies AM : Of the content, because every school is going to be very different at this. </s> Steve Davies : In terms of developing the guidance and the curriculum going out in January is concerned, I think\u2014again, I don't want to be overly critical, but one of the findings was that they encouraged schools to go forth and multiply in terms of the materials and ideas and concepts that were coming through. What we learnt was to actually\u2014the pioneer movement was to get a smaller group to develop those materials and look to engage through cluster groups. So, we had pioneers who worked with clusters to test the development of that concept before we were looking for schools to go away and develop a larger amount of content. So, in terms of the staging and measuring of bringing together the curriculum and the associated guidance, I think the time we've taken to actually get there and the strategy of using pioneer schools, external experts, back to pioneer schools, back to regions, or engaging regions in that, has been more measured and planned against a planned timescale, where everyone from the outset\u2014with the exception of the extension of the one year\u2014was clear on when we were going to be producing materials that would allow the profession to then take it and use it. I think\u2014. Claire, do you want to add to that, or\u2014? </s> Claire Bennett : I think, as we move forward, that kind of cluster approach remains really important. So, it's, as schools then think about, 'What am I going to do in my school?', that they're doing that in clusters together. When colleagues from the regional consortia were sharing their thinking with the curriculum assessment group last week, they were talking about the very specific and differentiated, I suppose, professional learning support that they would be offering to schools that have already done quite a lot of thinking and are quite far down this journey and then the kind of different sorts of approaches they would offer schools that are just starting out. Their emphasis was very much on this peer-to-peer sharing and support, so people aren't just going off in isolation. The other thing that will also help in that process will be the national network. So, there'll continue to be a focus for each area of learning and experience, bringing together the professional learning and the ongoing curriculum development, bringing together practitioners and experts and colleagues across the middle tier to give a bit of strategic direction and to be able to identify if there are areas where more support is needed. So, I think that a huge amount of thinking, particularly in the regions, has gone on into the practical support that can be given to schools, not just in engaging with the curriculum now, but then how they take it and think about then developing it in their schools. It feels like\u2014I think Graham Donaldson was calling it a 'slow-burn process'. You don't start in 2022\u2014people are already doing it and there's a lot of thought going into how to support continued sharing through the next two years. </s> Kirsty Williams AM : And I think that's another difference, you see\u2014that strong middle tier and the role that the middle tier is playing in Wales, which was absent in Scotland. So, this ability to work in networks to provide support to a network of schools, that wasn't available in the Scottish system and I think that makes\u2014I think that helps us in the way that they just simply didn't have a structure that allowed them to do that. It's not a criticism of them; it's just that we have got a structure that we can utilise to do that support so that schools are not completely left on their own and they can be working with other schools, with their regional consortia, going forward. </s> Suzy Davies AM : Can I just have a quick\u2014? </s> Lynne Neagle AM : Very quickly, because I want to move on to implementation. </s> Suzy Davies AM : Yes, sorry, I completely understand. Was one of the things that Scotland did\u2014I don't want to use the word 'assess'\u2014to monitor the pupil response to the curriculum as one of the means of deciding whether curricula in particular schools were working well enough? </s> Kirsty Williams AM : I don't know if they\u2014. I don't know if they did, but one of the interesting things that we were reflecting on over the weekend is that, certainly some of the Canadian systems, in particular, which we were interested in, used pupil surveys as part of their accountability regime\u2014so, actually taking the time to ask students how they felt, not just about the content of the new curriculum, but actually how they felt their school was doing. And so we're interested in looking, as I said, at some of the practices that other countries use to include pupil voice to find out what's happening. </s> Suzy Davies AM : Okay, that's interesting. Okay, thank you. </s> Kirsty Williams AM : Yes. I mean, it's early thoughts, because we've only just heard about it ourselves. But that's the beauty of working with other countries. They found that particular useful and successful, and we're keen to see if we could do something similar.",

I thought \" well I 'm gonna just look at the {disfmarker} what actual digit strings do occur in the training data . \" </s> Professor A : Right . </s> PhD B : And the interesting thing was it turns out that there are no sequences of two - long or three - long digit strings {pause} in any of the Aurora training data . So it 's either one , four , five , six , uh up to eleven , and then it skips and then there 's some at sixteen . </s> Professor A : But what about the testing data ? </s> PhD B : Um . I don't know . I didn't look at the test data yet . </s> Professor A : Yeah . I mean if there 's some testing data that has {disfmarker} has {disfmarker} {vocalsound} has two or three {disfmarker} </s> PhD B : So . Yeah . But I just thought that was a little odd , that there were no two or three long {disfmarker} Sorry .

Um well w we uh we had discussed this already in the fin in the previous uh discussion . {vocalsound} Uh the method of the remote control is just {disfmarker} the function of remote control is basically to send messages to the television set . So that was the main uh important thing what a remote control should do . </s> Project Manager : Yeah . </s> User Interface : Then I found uh two different kind of remote controls , the multi-function uh remote control with many possibilities , but um the lack of the feeling I already mentioned uh in the previous uh discussion . </s> Project Manager : Mm-hmm . </s> User Interface : And the ease-of-use remote control with uh the less p possibilities but a great feeling in in touching the buttons . </s> Project Manager : Yeah . </s> User Interface : {vocalsound} Um but um {disfmarker} yeah . My personal preferences were ease of uh {disfmarker} the easy to use remote control , because uh the user-friendliness and uh {disfmarker} it can be more trendy in in user design . But um your new goal f was for uh people than {disfmarker} less than forty years old . </s> Project Manager : Uh-huh . </s> User Interface : So maybe um the multi-function can be implemented in uh in our design . But it should b I think it should be a combination , but teletext buttons are not uh in our design . So it should uh take out , well , eight buttons or so . But my {disfmarker} in {gap} my opinion , the the easy to use R_C_ is uh the best uh possi possibility for us . </s> Project Manager : Okay . Uh Ruud , did you get that ? </s> User Interface : Yeah . </s> Marketing : Yeah , uh b uh most . </s> Project Manager : Okay , so </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : the important thing here is {disfmarker} </s> User Interface : {vocalsound} And it's also i indeed uh uh Ruud's uh insight in the in the topic . </s> Marketing : Oh , user-friendly . </s> Project Manager : In the market , yeah . </s> User Interface : Yeah , what what does the market want ? I I don't know . </s> Project Manager : Yeah , okay , w we will s we all uh {disfmarker} </s> User Interface : Just for uh for user desi uh user uh friendliness I uh should choose for the the ease of use remote control . </s> Project Manager : Yeah . Okay . Sebastian . </s> User Interface : And just about uh the user interface , I came up with um {vocalsound} an easy remote control and an advanced remote control . </s> Project Manager : Yeah . </s> User Interface : What should we choose in in design ? </s> Project Manager : Yeah . Well , um according to Ruud , um people do not use um all the extra features very very often . </s> User Interface : Well , the extra functions . </s> Project Manager : So {disfmarker} </s> Marketing : I have the numbers r I have the numbers right here . </s> Project Manager : Okay . </s> Marketing : Well , t uh we won't support teletext which which was the third-most {disfmarker} the second-most used function . </s> User Interface : Used option . </s> Project Manager : Okay . {vocalsound} </s> Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Okay . {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : Well , we we do have a wise board , so I'm not questioning that . {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} </s> User Interface : {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : Uh well {disfmarker} yeah , channel selection is obviously the most important . </s> Project Manager : Yeah . Okay , so on the relevance scale uh the channel selection , the volume selection and the teletext . </s> Marketing : So {disfmarker} Yeah . Yeah . </s> Project Manager : Well , we skip that . </s> Marketing : So {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : Okay . </s> User Interface : Well , so it just th the basic functions . And we don't have to use it for D_V_D_ players uh and all kind of stuff . </s> Industrial Designer : No , no . </s> Project Manager : No . </s> User Interface : So {disfmarker} {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : Nope . </s> Industrial Designer : So that's out of the question . </s> Project Manager : Yeah . </s> User Interface : Yeah . Just through uh the easy uh design . We can make uh a nice design when when there's not mu uh much buttons in it . </s> Industrial Designer : So {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : Uh uh uh I think we should go for the easier one . </s> Industrial Designer : I think also . Yes . Well , </s> Project Manager : No . </s> User Interface : So {disfmarker} </s> Industrial Designer : we should save costs uh by not implementing a lot of functions and uh the money that we can save from that we should use for uh having a nice design and uh thinking about the user interface </s> Project Manager : Yeah . Okay , </s> Industrial Designer : and {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : Ruud , how do you feel about that ? Uh do you agree , do you think the market would would respond to uh a simple {disfmarker} </s> Marketing : Uh well if we um include other uh innovative functions {disfmarker} {vocalsound} uh then they uh might , </s> Project Manager : Mm-hmm . </s> Marketing : 'cause young people uh like new features . </s> Project Manager : Mm yeah . </s> Marketing : So {disfmarker} </s> Industrial Designer : Yeah , that's right . </s> Project Manager : Okay , so this is is kind of uh {disfmarker} </s> Industrial Designer : Mm . </s> User Interface : Uh just a few buttons , trendy design , nice lightning effects wh and the sound . </s> Industrial Designer : Okay . Well , is it {disfmarker} maybe there's another possibility . You can make it look like an easy s piece of equipment , but it's quite elaborated , uh because it has many functions . </s> Project Manager : Yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : Maybe it's more important to make the {disfmarker} make it look like a very uh friendly , easy to catch piece of equipment , but um nevertheless {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : But but are we not in in the in the manual uh {disfmarker} I mean if you have few buttons , no display , um I mean uh I guess it's l it's working with with a shift functions and um one button can uh </s> Industrial Designer : Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Ok like that . Well , I was more thinking about a more elaborate way of controlling , by by these kinds of sticks or something like that . I don't know if if it's user-friendly . That's your field of expertise . </s> Project Manager : But but how does how does the remote uh report uh r uh give back to the user w in what state it is ? </s> User Interface : Yeah , I don't know yet . {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : Because we do not implement uh a user history . </s> Industrial Designer : Mm-hmm . There's {disfmarker} no , but there's no way to do that , because we cannot implement that kind of the system . </s> Project Manager : I know , but but if we use uh like a stick , for example , um {disfmarker} </s> Industrial Designer : W Mm-hmm . Well , maybe we can use a light for that . When you move the stick to a to a position , maybe uh a light next to it can lit up . So you know I've just uh pushed the button , or I changed the channel or t uh turned up the volume . Something like that . </s> Marketing : And if you use that stick for volume control and channel uh selection , you have the m two most important functions in one uh button . </s> Project Manager : Yeah . Uh and we could have other buttons for the for the advanced uh functions . </s> Industrial Designer : Yes . </s> User Interface : But does it {disfmarker} uh I then should n just use uh i instead of the stick , uh like many cell phones , just a round m well , </s> Project Manager : Yeah , draw draw it on the board . </s> User Interface : should we just use a {disfmarker} Um it's already uh {disfmarker} oh , we have a blank . Oh . </s> Industrial Designer : yeah , something like that . Oh </s> User Interface : It's just an easy uh way of of a round button what {disfmarker} which can be pushed in four directions . Instead of a stick . </s> Industrial Designer : It's not really a stick , but {disfmarker} Yes . Yes . </s> User Interface : A stick is v vulnerab vulnerable when it's falling down </s> Project Manager : Yeah , it can break down . </s> Industrial Designer : Hmm . </s> User Interface : or uh </s> Industrial Designer : Yes , yes . </s> User Interface : just a round uh button should be the trick , I think . </s> Marketing : Yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : And {disfmarker} Yes , and this also looks more fancy , I think . </s> User Interface : Yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : I think it it will attract uh more uh uh public , I think . </s> Marketing : A younger uh {disfmarker} Huh . </s> Industrial Designer : But you're the marketing man . </s> Marketing : And it's also quite easy to use , so it'll {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} uh attract younger people because well new , and it might attract older people because it's easy to use . </s> User Interface : Geez . Well , volume and something uh like that . {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : Uh-huh . {vocalsound} </s> User Interface : The programme up and down . {vocalsound} </s> Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : Okay , yeah . </s> User Interface : And the vol yeah , the pen doesn't uh really does what I want . </s> Industrial Designer : Okay , that's good . </s> Project Manager : Okay , but w we still {vocalsound} we're still in the question of uh um uh putting in advanced options . Um Ruud just told us um the market is interested in some advanced uh new techniques . Um however , uh keeping it simple is is important for the costs and all all those kind of things . We need to find a balance between uh the advanced techniques and and the user-friendliness . </s> Industrial Designer : Mm-hmm . </s> User Interface : But I think our our next step to look at is just that . So I don't think it's {disfmarker} um we have something to do . Uh we can't discuss it right now , because n no one of us have {disfmarker} has the information to discuss about that , I think . </s> Project Manager : Um well , for {disfmarker} we do have to uh decide this this meeting . Yeah . </s> User Interface : Yes ? </s> Project Manager : We need to um have the uh the user function {disfmarker} uh the functions decided and um {vocalsound} uh our target audience . </s> User Interface : Mm-hmm . </s> Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Okay . </s> User Interface : but teletext is so uh is just scrapped . 'Kay , </s> Industrial Designer : Okay . Do do you want a list of functions ? Do you want an explicit list ? Uh which uh incorporates all function available on the device ? </s> Project Manager : Um well , I do not want a full uh {disfmarker} it's not necessary to to have a full list , but I want um the kind of functions , for example uh th the most important are volume and uh programme selecting . </s> Industrial Designer : Okay . Okay . </s> User Interface : The ten digits . </s> Industrial Designer : Mm-hmm . </s> Project Manager : Well , for example , that that's what we should think about . {gap} l how is the remote going to look ? Not not in the user interface , but {disfmarker} </s> User Interface : Oh , and just one function . The the the the programme to programme button , the switch to uh two channels , when you have uh something on channel four and something on channel six , just one button which which can uh change </s> Industrial Designer : Mm-hmm . Yes . </s> Project Manager : Yeah . A bit of a split mode . </s> Industrial Designer : Change . </s> Project Manager : Uh l like {disfmarker} Yeah . </s> User Interface : {disfmarker} yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : Yes , yes . </s> Project Manager : Dual channel watch . </s> Industrial Designer : Yes . </s> Project Manager : Okay , well um </s> User Interface : Yeah . </s> Project Manager : m maybe I should write that down . {vocalsound} </s> Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Well {disfmarker} {vocalsound} </s> User Interface : {vocalsound} </s> Industrial Designer : you're the secretary . {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : Uh Ruud , um what's your last name ? </s> Marketing : Mielsen . </s> Project Manager : Mielsen , because I I was writing it down in the last uh {disfmarker} Mielsen . Right . Um I put all the minutes I make into the shared folder . So if you want to have a look at it , you know where to find it . Um {disfmarker} </s> Industrial Designer : Mm okay , </s> User Interface : Alright . </s> Industrial Designer : but make a s make a sub-folder for it , because it's starting to fill up already . {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : Yeah , that's that's {disfmarker} </s> Marketing : Yeah . </s> Project Manager : if you want to do it , Sebastian . {vocalsound} </s> User Interface : {vocalsound} Our B_S_C_ uh W_ uh {disfmarker} </s> Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Sure . {vocalsound} {gap} . {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : Okay , um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Okay , so so um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} uh {disfmarker} </s> User Interface : {vocalsound} {gap} {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : Volume . Programme . Uh dual channel . Uh {disfmarker} </s> Industrial Designer : Yes , that's important . </s> Project Manager : And and do we want um the ten digits ? </s> User Interface : The ten digits ? Yeah , I believe so . </s> Industrial Designer : Well , are are you sure ? </s> Marketing : Well , if you want to go to channel ninety and you have th that button . </s> Industrial Designer : I'm not so sure . </s> User Interface : Yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : Well , that's complicated , </s> Project Manager : Yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : but is that so relevant ? Because I don't think {disfmarker} but you should uh shou you should know that . If it were so . </s> User Interface : I wouldn't buy it personally . A remote control without the ten digits . </s> Industrial Designer : Okay , </s> User Interface : Uh and I think the most {disfmarker} </s> Industrial Designer : I can imagine when </s> Project Manager : I agree actually . {vocalsound} </s> User Interface : Just elder elder people would would buy it , </s> Industrial Designer : I can imagine when you're {disfmarker} when you have a satellite decoder and and you have , well , about six hundred channels , I can imagine you want this . </s> Marketing : Well {disfmarker} </s> User Interface : but {disfmarker} </s> Industrial Designer : But if you're uh a regular T_V_ user , and you just want uh to watch the the Dutch television networks , well , you can uh {disfmarker} {gap} {disfmarker} you can use uh about ten buttons . That's enough . </s> Project Manager : But we do have thirteen different Dutch channels . </s> Marketing : But {disfmarker} </s> User Interface : Yep . The older people only use five of them . </s> Industrial Designer : Well , </s> Marketing : Yeah , </s> Industrial Designer : but how how often do you watch all these channels ? </s> Marketing : and if if we {disfmarker} And if we are targeting at the younger audience , they will probably watch more channels than the older people . </s> Project Manager : Often . </s> Industrial Designer : No , you're probably right . </s> Marketing : So {disfmarker} </s> User Interface : Yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : Okay . But I think these uh ten uh buttons look a bit dull . Don't you think ? </s> Project Manager : Well , it depends on the on the on the looks , on the on the {disfmarker} </s> Industrial Designer : The design . </s> User Interface : On the design . </s> Industrial Designer : Okay . Well , y then there should be {disfmarker} should done {disfmarker} be done something specific with it . </s> Marketing : Well {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : You c {vocalsound} you can d make them very fancy </s> Marketing : And {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : by um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I mean Nokia , they have ten digits on their phones and it still looks very fancy . </s> Industrial Designer : Mm-hmm . </s> Project Manager : So I'm I'm {disfmarker} I do not agree {disfmarker} </s> User Interface : Yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : Okay , so you can experiment by {disfmarker} uh with with shape or with size or with colour , that kind of thing . </s> Project Manager : Exactly , exactly . </s> Industrial Designer : Okay . </s> Marketing : And um there are some numbers about uh speech recognition here that uh younger people would like it . Uh it might be expensive and uh hard to implement , but it would be a solution uh for {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : Okay , speech . </s> Industrial Designer : Well , maybe it can be combined with the find the remote control . </s> User Interface : Yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : So um when you add uh speech recognition to your remote control , uh it's very easy to change uh the channel . That's one thing . </s> Project Manager : Yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : And it's very easy uh to find your remote control . </s> Project Manager : To find {disfmarker} yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : So maybe that's a possibility , but I'm afraid it will be a bit costly . </s> Marketing : Yeah . </s> Project Manager : Uh {disfmarker} If if we would um drop the ten digits </s> Industrial Designer : But maybe when we uh {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : but keep the programme and the volume , </s> Industrial Designer : Mm-hmm . </s> Project Manager : because maybe people do not always want to use their voice , um {disfmarker} </s> Industrial Designer : Okay . Okay , okay . </s> Marketing : Especially elder people uh don't like voice recognition . So then we should implement such a but </s> Project Manager : Yeah . But we do focus on younger people . We d it it's a board uh decision . </s> Industrial Designer : Okay . </s> Marketing : Yes . </s> Industrial Designer : Well . I I think it should uh should work , it sh we should manage that . </s> User Interface : So </s> Project Manager : Okay . </s> User Interface : we have to i to make um a decision between the ten digits or the voice recognition . </s> Industrial Designer : Yes . Well , the voice recognition has the main adva has another advantage . It's mas it makes it very easy for us to implement the find uh find the remote control button {disfmarker} uh remote control function . </s> User Interface : Mm-hmm . </s> Project Manager : Okay . </s> Industrial Designer : So that's that's a big advantage , I think . </s> Project Manager : Okay , g good . </s> User Interface : {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : Okay . </s> Industrial Designer : There's only one disadvantage uh by implementing this . Um the power saving power saving will be a bit more difficult . So we can expect that there will be a less longer life to the batteries .",

Yeah . </s> Project Manager : Well , we skip that . </s> Marketing : So {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : Okay . </s> User Interface : Well , so it just th the basic functions .

Mm-hmm . Ok like that . Well , I was more thinking about a more elaborate way of controlling , by by these kinds of sticks or something like that . I don't know if if it's user-friendly . That's your field of expertise . </s> Project Manager : But but how does how does the remote uh report uh r uh give back to the user w in what state it is ? </s> User Interface : Yeah , I don't know yet . {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : Because we do not implement uh a user history . </s> Industrial Designer : Mm-hmm . There's {disfmarker} no , but there's no way to do that , because we cannot implement that kind of the system . </s> Project Manager : I know , but but if we use uh like a stick , for example , um {disfmarker} </s> Industrial Designer : W Mm-hmm . Well , maybe we can use a light for that . When you move the stick to a to a position , maybe uh a light next to it can lit up . So you know I've just uh pushed the button , or I changed the channel or t uh turned up the volume .

Oh . </s> Industrial Designer : yeah , something like that . Oh </s> User Interface : It's just an easy uh way of of a round button what {disfmarker} which can be pushed in four directions . Instead of a stick . </s> Industrial Designer : It's not really a stick , but {disfmarker} Yes . Yes . </s> User Interface : A stick is v vulnerab vulnerable when it's falling down </s> Project Manager : Yeah , it can break down . </s> Industrial Designer : Hmm . </s> User Interface : or uh </s> Industrial Designer : Yes , yes . </s> User Interface : just a round uh button should be the trick , I think . </s> Marketing : Yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : And {disfmarker} Yes , and this also looks more fancy , I think . </s> User Interface : Yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : I think it it will attract uh more uh uh public , I think . </s> Marketing : A younger uh {disfmarker} Huh . </s> Industrial Designer : But you're the marketing man . </s> Marketing : And it's also quite easy to use , so it'll {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} uh attract younger people because well new , and it might attract older people because it's easy to use . </s> User Interface : Geez . Well , volume and something uh like that . {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : Uh-huh . {vocalsound} </s> User Interface : The programme up and down . {vocalsound} </s> Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : Okay , yeah . </s> User Interface : And the vol yeah , the pen doesn't uh really does what I want . </s> Industrial Designer : Okay , that's good . </s> Project Manager : Okay , but w we still {vocalsound} we're still in the question of uh um uh putting in advanced options . Um Ruud just told us um the market is interested in some advanced uh new techniques . Um however , uh keeping it simple is is important for the costs and all all those kind of things . We need to find a balance between uh the advanced techniques and and the user-friendliness . </s> Industrial Designer : Mm-hmm . </s> User Interface : But I think our our next step to look at is just that . So I don't think it's {disfmarker} um we have something to do . Uh we can't discuss it right now , because n no one of us have {disfmarker} has the information to discuss about that , I think . </s> Project Manager : Um well , for {disfmarker} we do have to uh decide this this meeting . Yeah . </s> User Interface : Yes ? </s> Project Manager : We need to um have the uh the user function {disfmarker} uh the functions decided and um {vocalsound} uh our target audience . </s> User Interface : Mm-hmm . </s> Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Okay . </s> User Interface : but teletext is so uh is just scrapped . 'Kay , </s> Industrial Designer : Okay . Do do you want a list of functions ? Do you want an explicit list ?

Okay . </s> User Interface : The ten digits . </s> Industrial Designer : Mm-hmm . </s> Project Manager : Well , for example , that that's what we should think about . {gap} l how is the remote going to look ? Not not in the user interface , but {disfmarker} </s> User Interface : Oh , and just one function . The the the the programme to programme button , the switch to uh two channels , when you have uh something on channel four and something on channel six , just one button which which can uh change </s> Industrial Designer : Mm-hmm .

Well , um according to Ruud , um people do not use um all the extra features very very often . </s> User Interface : Well , the extra functions . </s> Project Manager : So {disfmarker} </s> Marketing : I have the numbers r I have the numbers right here . </s> Project Manager : Okay . </s> Marketing : Well , t uh we won't support teletext which which was the third-most {disfmarker} the second-most used function . </s> User Interface : Used option . </s> Project Manager : Okay . {vocalsound} </s> Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Okay . {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : Well , we we do have a wise board , so I'm not questioning that . {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} </s> User Interface : {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : Uh well {disfmarker} yeah , channel selection is obviously the most important . </s> Project Manager : Yeah . Okay , so on the relevance scale uh the channel selection , the volume selection and the teletext . </s> Marketing : So {disfmarker} Yeah . Yeah . </s> Project Manager : Well , we skip that . </s> Marketing : So {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : Okay . </s> User Interface : Well , so it just th the basic functions . And we don't have to use it for D_V_D_ players uh and all kind of stuff . </s> Industrial Designer : No , no . </s> Project Manager : No . </s> User Interface : So {disfmarker} {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : Nope . </s> Industrial Designer : So that's out of the question . </s> Project Manager : Yeah . </s> User Interface : Yeah . Just through uh the easy uh design . We can make uh a nice design when when there's not mu uh much buttons in it . </s> Industrial Designer : So {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : Uh uh uh I think we should go for the easier one . </s> Industrial Designer : I think also . Yes . Well , </s> Project Manager : No . </s> User Interface : So {disfmarker} </s> Industrial Designer : we should save costs uh by not implementing a lot of functions and uh the money that we can save from that we should use for uh having a nice design and uh thinking about the user interface </s> Project Manager : Yeah . Okay , </s> Industrial Designer : and {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : Ruud , how do you feel about that ? Uh do you agree , do you think the market would would respond to uh a simple {disfmarker} </s> Marketing : Uh well if we um include other uh innovative functions {disfmarker} {vocalsound} uh then they uh might , </s> Project Manager : Mm-hmm . </s> Marketing : 'cause young people uh like new features . </s> Project Manager : Mm yeah . </s> Marketing : So {disfmarker} </s> Industrial Designer : Yeah , that's right . </s> Project Manager : Okay , so this is is kind of uh {disfmarker} </s> Industrial Designer : Mm . </s> User Interface : Uh just a few buttons , trendy design , nice lightning effects wh and the sound . </s> Industrial Designer : Okay . Well , is it {disfmarker} maybe there's another possibility . You can make it look like an easy s piece of equipment , but it's quite elaborated , uh because it has many functions . </s> Project Manager : Yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : Maybe it's more important to make the {disfmarker} make it look like a very uh friendly , easy to catch piece of equipment , but um nevertheless {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : But but are we not in in the in the manual uh {disfmarker} I mean if you have few buttons , no display , um I mean uh I guess it's l it's working with with a shift functions and um one button can uh </s> Industrial Designer : Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Ok like that . Well , I was more thinking about a more elaborate way of controlling , by by these kinds of sticks or something like that . I don't know if if it's user-friendly . That's your field of expertise . </s> Project Manager : But but how does how does the remote uh report uh r uh give back to the user w in what state it is ? </s> User Interface : Yeah , I don't know yet . {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : Because we do not implement uh a user history . </s> Industrial Designer : Mm-hmm . There's {disfmarker} no , but there's no way to do that , because we cannot implement that kind of the system . </s> Project Manager : I know , but but if we use uh like a stick , for example , um {disfmarker} </s> Industrial Designer : W Mm-hmm . Well , maybe we can use a light for that . When you move the stick to a to a position , maybe uh a light next to it can lit up . So you know I've just uh pushed the button , or I changed the channel or t uh turned up the volume . Something like that . </s> Marketing : And if you use that stick for volume control and channel uh selection , you have the m two most important functions in one uh button . </s> Project Manager : Yeah . Uh and we could have other buttons for the for the advanced uh functions . </s> Industrial Designer : Yes . </s> User Interface : But does it {disfmarker} uh I then should n just use uh i instead of the stick , uh like many cell phones , just a round m well , </s> Project Manager : Yeah , draw draw it on the board . </s> User Interface : should we just use a {disfmarker} Um it's already uh {disfmarker} oh , we have a blank . Oh . </s> Industrial Designer : yeah , something like that . Oh </s> User Interface : It's just an easy uh way of of a round button what {disfmarker} which can be pushed in four directions . Instead of a stick . </s> Industrial Designer : It's not really a stick , but {disfmarker} Yes . Yes . </s> User Interface : A stick is v vulnerab vulnerable when it's falling down </s> Project Manager : Yeah , it can break down . </s> Industrial Designer : Hmm . </s> User Interface : or uh </s> Industrial Designer : Yes , yes . </s> User Interface : just a round uh button should be the trick , I think . </s> Marketing : Yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : And {disfmarker} Yes , and this also looks more fancy , I think . </s> User Interface : Yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : I think it it will attract uh more uh uh public , I think . </s> Marketing : A younger uh {disfmarker} Huh . </s> Industrial Designer : But you're the marketing man . </s> Marketing : And it's also quite easy to use , so it'll {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} uh attract younger people because well new , and it might attract older people because it's easy to use . </s> User Interface : Geez . Well , volume and something uh like that . {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : Uh-huh . {vocalsound} </s> User Interface : The programme up and down . {vocalsound} </s> Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : Okay , yeah . </s> User Interface : And the vol yeah , the pen doesn't uh really does what I want . </s> Industrial Designer : Okay , that's good . </s> Project Manager : Okay , but w we still {vocalsound} we're still in the question of uh um uh putting in advanced options . Um Ruud just told us um the market is interested in some advanced uh new techniques . Um however , uh keeping it simple is is important for the costs and all all those kind of things . We need to find a balance between uh the advanced techniques and and the user-friendliness . </s> Industrial Designer : Mm-hmm . </s> User Interface : But I think our our next step to look at is just that . So I don't think it's {disfmarker} um we have something to do . Uh we can't discuss it right now , because n no one of us have {disfmarker} has the information to discuss about that , I think . </s> Project Manager : Um well , for {disfmarker} we do have to uh decide this this meeting . Yeah . </s> User Interface : Yes ? </s> Project Manager : We need to um have the uh the user function {disfmarker} uh the functions decided and um {vocalsound} uh our target audience . </s> User Interface : Mm-hmm . </s> Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Okay . </s> User Interface : but teletext is so uh is just scrapped . 'Kay , </s> Industrial Designer : Okay . Do do you want a list of functions ? Do you want an explicit list ? Uh which uh incorporates all function available on the device ? </s> Project Manager : Um well , I do not want a full uh {disfmarker} it's not necessary to to have a full list , but I want um the kind of functions , for example uh th the most important are volume and uh programme selecting . </s> Industrial Designer : Okay . Okay . </s> User Interface : The ten digits . </s> Industrial Designer : Mm-hmm . </s> Project Manager : Well , for example , that that's what we should think about . {gap} l how is the remote going to look ? Not not in the user interface , but {disfmarker} </s> User Interface : Oh , and just one function . The the the the programme to programme button , the switch to uh two channels , when you have uh something on channel four and something on channel six , just one button which which can uh change </s> Industrial Designer : Mm-hmm . Yes . </s> Project Manager : Yeah . A bit of a split mode . </s> Industrial Designer : Change . </s> Project Manager : Uh l like {disfmarker} Yeah . </s> User Interface : {disfmarker} yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : Yes , yes . </s> Project Manager : Dual channel watch . </s> Industrial Designer : Yes . </s> Project Manager : Okay , well um </s> User Interface : Yeah . </s> Project Manager : m maybe I should write that down . {vocalsound} </s> Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Well {disfmarker} {vocalsound} </s> User Interface : {vocalsound} </s> Industrial Designer : you're the secretary . {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : Uh Ruud , um what's your last name ? </s> Marketing : Mielsen . </s> Project Manager : Mielsen , because I I was writing it down in the last uh {disfmarker} Mielsen . Right . Um I put all the minutes I make into the shared folder . So if you want to have a look at it , you know where to find it . Um {disfmarker} </s> Industrial Designer : Mm okay , </s> User Interface : Alright . </s> Industrial Designer : but make a s make a sub-folder for it , because it's starting to fill up already . {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : Yeah , that's that's {disfmarker} </s> Marketing : Yeah . </s> Project Manager : if you want to do it , Sebastian . {vocalsound} </s> User Interface : {vocalsound} Our B_S_C_ uh W_ uh {disfmarker} </s> Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Sure . {vocalsound} {gap} . {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : Okay , um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Okay , so so um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} uh {disfmarker} </s> User Interface : {vocalsound} {gap} {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : Volume . Programme . Uh dual channel . Uh {disfmarker} </s> Industrial Designer : Yes , that's important . </s> Project Manager : And and do we want um the ten digits ? </s> User Interface : The ten digits ? Yeah , I believe so . </s> Industrial Designer : Well , are are you sure ? </s> Marketing : Well , if you want to go to channel ninety and you have th that button . </s> Industrial Designer : I'm not so sure . </s> User Interface : Yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : Well , that's complicated , </s> Project Manager : Yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : but is that so relevant ? Because I don't think {disfmarker} but you should uh shou you should know that . If it were so . </s> User Interface : I wouldn't buy it personally . A remote control without the ten digits . </s> Industrial Designer : Okay , </s> User Interface : Uh and I think the most {disfmarker} </s> Industrial Designer : I can imagine when </s> Project Manager : I agree actually . {vocalsound} </s> User Interface : Just elder elder people would would buy it , </s> Industrial Designer : I can imagine when you're {disfmarker} when you have a satellite decoder and and you have , well , about six hundred channels , I can imagine you want this . </s> Marketing : Well {disfmarker} </s> User Interface : but {disfmarker} </s> Industrial Designer : But if you're uh a regular T_V_ user , and you just want uh to watch the the Dutch television networks , well , you can uh {disfmarker} {gap} {disfmarker} you can use uh about ten buttons . That's enough . </s> Project Manager : But we do have thirteen different Dutch channels . </s> Marketing : But {disfmarker} </s> User Interface : Yep . The older people only use five of them . </s> Industrial Designer : Well , </s> Marketing : Yeah , </s> Industrial Designer : but how how often do you watch all these channels ? </s> Marketing : and if if we {disfmarker} And if we are targeting at the younger audience , they will probably watch more channels than the older people . </s> Project Manager : Often . </s> Industrial Designer : No , you're probably right . </s> Marketing : So {disfmarker} </s> User Interface : Yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : Okay . But I think these uh ten uh buttons look a bit dull . Don't you think ? </s> Project Manager : Well , it depends on the on the on the looks , on the on the {disfmarker} </s> Industrial Designer : The design . </s> User Interface : On the design . </s> Industrial Designer : Okay . Well , y then there should be {disfmarker} should done {disfmarker} be done something specific with it . </s> Marketing : Well {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : You c {vocalsound} you can d make them very fancy </s> Marketing : And {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : by um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I mean Nokia , they have ten digits on their phones and it still looks very fancy . </s> Industrial Designer : Mm-hmm . </s> Project Manager : So I'm I'm {disfmarker} I do not agree {disfmarker} </s> User Interface : Yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : Okay , so you can experiment by {disfmarker} uh with with shape or with size or with colour , that kind of thing . </s> Project Manager : Exactly , exactly . </s> Industrial Designer : Okay . </s> Marketing : And um there are some numbers about uh speech recognition here that uh younger people would like it . Uh it might be expensive and uh hard to implement , but it would be a solution uh for {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : Okay , speech . </s> Industrial Designer : Well , maybe it can be combined with the find the remote control . </s> User Interface : Yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : So um when you add uh speech recognition to your remote control , uh it's very easy to change uh the channel . That's one thing . </s> Project Manager : Yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : And it's very easy uh to find your remote control . </s> Project Manager : To find {disfmarker} yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : So maybe that's a possibility , but I'm afraid it will be a bit costly . </s> Marketing : Yeah . </s> Project Manager : Uh {disfmarker} If if we would um drop the ten digits </s> Industrial Designer : But maybe when we uh {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : but keep the programme and the volume , </s> Industrial Designer : Mm-hmm . </s> Project Manager : because maybe people do not always want to use their voice , um {disfmarker} </s> Industrial Designer : Okay . Okay , okay . </s> Marketing : Especially elder people uh don't like voice recognition . So then we should implement such a but </s> Project Manager : Yeah . But we do focus on younger people . We d it it's a board uh decision . </s> Industrial Designer : Okay . </s> Marketing : Yes . </s> Industrial Designer : Well . I I think it should uh should work , it sh we should manage that . </s> User Interface : So </s> Project Manager : Okay . </s> User Interface : we have to i to make um a decision between the ten digits or the voice recognition . </s> Industrial Designer : Yes . Well , the voice recognition has the main adva has another advantage . It's mas it makes it very easy for us to implement the find uh find the remote control button {disfmarker} uh remote control function . </s> User Interface : Mm-hmm . </s> Project Manager : Okay . </s> Industrial Designer : So that's that's a big advantage , I think . </s> Project Manager : Okay , g good . </s> User Interface : {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : Okay . </s> Industrial Designer : There's only one disadvantage uh by implementing this . Um the power saving power saving will be a bit more difficult . So we can expect that there will be a less longer life to the batteries .",

Yeah . </s> Project Manager : Well , we skip that . </s> Marketing : So {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : Okay . </s> User Interface : Well , so it just th the basic functions .

Mm-hmm . Ok like that . Well , I was more thinking about a more elaborate way of controlling , by by these kinds of sticks or something like that . I don't know if if it's user-friendly . That's your field of expertise . </s> Project Manager : But but how does how does the remote uh report uh r uh give back to the user w in what state it is ? </s> User Interface : Yeah , I don't know yet . {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : Because we do not implement uh a user history . </s> Industrial Designer : Mm-hmm . There's {disfmarker} no , but there's no way to do that , because we cannot implement that kind of the system . </s> Project Manager : I know , but but if we use uh like a stick , for example , um {disfmarker} </s> Industrial Designer : W Mm-hmm . Well , maybe we can use a light for that . When you move the stick to a to a position , maybe uh a light next to it can lit up . So you know I've just uh pushed the button , or I changed the channel or t uh turned up the volume . Something like that . </s> Marketing : And if you use that stick for volume control and channel uh selection , you have the m two most important functions in one uh button . </s> Project Manager : Yeah . Uh and we could have other buttons for the for the advanced uh functions . </s> Industrial Designer : Yes . </s> User Interface : But does it {disfmarker} uh I then should n just use uh i instead of the stick , uh like many cell phones , just a round m well , </s> Project Manager : Yeah , draw draw it on the board . </s> User Interface : should we just use a {disfmarker} Um it's already uh {disfmarker} oh , we have a blank . Oh . </s> Industrial Designer : yeah , something like that . Oh </s> User Interface : It's just an easy uh way of of a round button what {disfmarker} which can be pushed in four directions . Instead of a stick . </s> Industrial Designer : It's not really a stick , but {disfmarker} Yes . Yes . </s> User Interface : A stick is v vulnerab vulnerable when it's falling down </s> Project Manager : Yeah , it can break down . </s> Industrial Designer : Hmm . </s> User Interface : or uh </s> Industrial Designer : Yes , yes . </s> User Interface : just a round uh button should be the trick , I think . </s> Marketing : Yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : And {disfmarker} Yes , and this also looks more fancy , I think . </s> User Interface : Yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : I think it it will attract uh more uh uh public , I think . </s> Marketing : A younger uh {disfmarker} Huh . </s> Industrial Designer : But you're the marketing man . </s> Marketing : And it's also quite easy to use , so it'll {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} uh attract younger people because well new , and it might attract older people because it's easy to use . </s> User Interface : Geez . Well , volume and something uh like that . {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : Uh-huh . {vocalsound} </s> User Interface : The programme up and down . {vocalsound} </s> Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : Okay , yeah . </s> User Interface : And the vol yeah , the pen doesn't uh really does what I want . </s> Industrial Designer : Okay , that's good . </s> Project Manager : Okay , but w we still {vocalsound} we're still in the question of uh um uh putting in advanced options . Um Ruud just told us um the market is interested in some advanced uh new techniques . Um however , uh keeping it simple is is important for the costs and all all those kind of things . We need to find a balance between uh the advanced techniques and and the user-friendliness . </s> Industrial Designer : Mm-hmm . </s> User Interface : But I think our our next step to look at is just that . So I don't think it's {disfmarker} um we have something to do . Uh we can't discuss it right now , because n no one of us have {disfmarker} has the information to discuss about that , I think . </s> Project Manager : Um well , for {disfmarker} we do have to uh decide this this meeting . Yeah . </s> User Interface : Yes ? </s> Project Manager : We need to um have the uh the user function {disfmarker} uh the functions decided and um {vocalsound} uh our target audience . </s> User Interface : Mm-hmm . </s> Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Okay . </s> User Interface : but teletext is so uh is just scrapped . 'Kay , </s> Industrial Designer : Okay . Do do you want a list of functions ? Do you want an explicit list ? Uh which uh incorporates all function available on the device ? </s> Project Manager : Um well , I do not want a full uh {disfmarker} it's not necessary to to have a full list , but I want um the kind of functions , for example uh th the most important are volume and uh programme selecting . </s> Industrial Designer : Okay . Okay . </s> User Interface : The ten digits . </s> Industrial Designer : Mm-hmm . </s> Project Manager : Well , for example , that that's what we should think about . {gap} l how is the remote going to look ? Not not in the user interface , but {disfmarker} </s> User Interface : Oh , and just one function . The the the the programme to programme button , the switch to uh two channels , when you have uh something on channel four and something on channel six , just one button which which can uh change </s> Industrial Designer : Mm-hmm . Yes . </s> Project Manager : Yeah . A bit of a split mode . </s> Industrial Designer : Change . </s> Project Manager : Uh l like {disfmarker} Yeah . </s> User Interface : {disfmarker} yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : Yes , yes . </s> Project Manager : Dual channel watch . </s> Industrial Designer : Yes . </s> Project Manager : Okay , well um </s> User Interface : Yeah . </s> Project Manager : m maybe I should write that down . {vocalsound} </s> Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Well {disfmarker} {vocalsound} </s> User Interface : {vocalsound} </s> Industrial Designer : you're the secretary . {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : Uh Ruud , um what's your last name ? </s> Marketing : Mielsen . </s> Project Manager : Mielsen , because I I was writing it down in the last uh {disfmarker} Mielsen . Right . Um I put all the minutes I make into the shared folder . So if you want to have a look at it , you know where to find it . Um {disfmarker} </s> Industrial Designer : Mm okay , </s> User Interface : Alright . </s> Industrial Designer : but make a s make a sub-folder for it , because it's starting to fill up already . {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : Yeah , that's that's {disfmarker} </s> Marketing : Yeah . </s> Project Manager : if you want to do it , Sebastian . {vocalsound} </s> User Interface : {vocalsound} Our B_S_C_ uh W_ uh {disfmarker} </s> Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Sure . {vocalsound} {gap} . {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : Okay , um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Okay , so so um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} uh {disfmarker} </s> User Interface : {vocalsound} {gap} {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : Volume .

Yeah , I believe so . </s> Industrial Designer : Well , are are you sure ? </s> Marketing : Well , if you want to go to channel ninety and you have th that button . </s> Industrial Designer : I'm not so sure . </s> User Interface : Yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : Well , that's complicated , </s> Project Manager : Yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : but is that so relevant ?

That's your field of expertise . </s> Project Manager : But but how does how does the remote uh report uh r uh give back to the user w in what state it is ? </s> User Interface : Yeah , I don't know yet . {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : Because we do not implement uh a user history . </s> Industrial Designer : Mm-hmm . There's {disfmarker} no , but there's no way to do that , because we cannot implement that kind of the system . </s> Project Manager : I know , but but if we use uh like a stick , for example , um {disfmarker} </s> Industrial Designer : W Mm-hmm . Well , maybe we can use a light for that . When you move the stick to a to a position , maybe uh a light next to it can lit up . So you know I've just uh pushed the button , or I changed the channel or t uh turned up the volume . Something like that . </s> Marketing : And if you use that stick for volume control and channel uh selection , you have the m two most important functions in one uh button . </s> Project Manager : Yeah . Uh and we could have other buttons for the for the advanced uh functions . </s> Industrial Designer : Yes . </s> User Interface : But does it {disfmarker} uh I then should n just use uh i instead of the stick , uh like many cell phones , just a round m well , </s> Project Manager : Yeah , draw draw it on the board . </s> User Interface : should we just use a {disfmarker} Um it's already uh {disfmarker} oh , we have a blank . Oh . </s> Industrial Designer : yeah , something like that . Oh </s> User Interface : It's just an easy uh way of of a round button what {disfmarker} which can be pushed in four directions .

Yes . </s> User Interface : A stick is v vulnerab vulnerable when it's falling down </s> Project Manager : Yeah , it can break down . </s> Industrial Designer : Hmm . </s> User Interface : or uh </s> Industrial Designer : Yes , yes . </s> User Interface : just a round uh button should be the trick , I think . </s> Marketing : Yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : And {disfmarker} Yes , and this also looks more fancy , I think . </s> User Interface : Yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : I think it it will attract uh more uh uh public , I think . </s> Marketing : A younger uh {disfmarker} Huh . </s> Industrial Designer : But you're the marketing man . </s> Marketing : And it's also quite easy to use , so it'll {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} uh attract younger people because well new , and it might attract older people because it's easy to use . </s> User Interface : Geez .

Uh we can't discuss it right now , because n no one of us have {disfmarker} has the information to discuss about that , I think . </s> Project Manager : Um well , for {disfmarker} we do have to uh decide this this meeting .

Right . Um I put all the minutes I make into the shared folder . So if you want to have a look at it , you know where to find it . Um {disfmarker} </s> Industrial Designer : Mm okay , </s> User Interface : Alright . </s> Industrial Designer : but make a s make a sub-folder for it , because it's starting to fill up already . {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : Yeah , that's that's {disfmarker} </s> Marketing : Yeah . </s> Project Manager : if you want to do it , Sebastian . {vocalsound} </s> User Interface : {vocalsound} Our B_S_C_ uh W_ uh {disfmarker} </s> Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Sure . {vocalsound} {gap} . {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : Okay , um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Okay , so so um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} uh {disfmarker} </s> User Interface : {vocalsound} {gap} {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : Volume .

Yeah , I believe so . </s> Industrial Designer : Well , are are you sure ? </s> Marketing : Well , if you want to go to channel ninety and you have th that button . </s> Industrial Designer : I'm not so sure . </s> User Interface : Yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : Well , that's complicated , </s> Project Manager : Yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : but is that so relevant ? Because I don't think {disfmarker} but you should uh shou you should know that . If it were so . </s> User Interface : I wouldn't buy it personally .

The older people only use five of them . </s> Industrial Designer : Well , </s> Marketing : Yeah , </s> Industrial Designer : but how how often do you watch all these channels ? </s> Marketing : and if if we {disfmarker} And if we are targeting at the younger audience , they will probably watch more channels than the older people . </s> Project Manager : Often . </s> Industrial Designer : No , you're probably right . </s> Marketing : So {disfmarker} </s> User Interface : Yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : Okay . But I think these uh ten uh buttons look a bit dull . Don't you think ? </s> Project Manager : Well , it depends on the on the on the looks , on the on the {disfmarker} </s> Industrial Designer : The design . </s> User Interface : On the design . </s> Industrial Designer : Okay . Well , y then there should be {disfmarker} should done {disfmarker} be done something specific with it . </s> Marketing : Well {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : You c {vocalsound} you can d make them very fancy </s> Marketing : And {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : by um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I mean Nokia , they have ten digits on their phones and it still looks very fancy . </s> Industrial Designer : Mm-hmm . </s> Project Manager : So I'm I'm {disfmarker} I do not agree {disfmarker} </s> User Interface : Yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : Okay , so you can experiment by {disfmarker} uh with with shape or with size or with colour , that kind of thing . </s> Project Manager : Exactly , exactly . </s> Industrial Designer : Okay . </s> Marketing : And um there are some numbers about uh speech recognition here that uh younger people would like it . Uh it might be expensive and uh hard to implement , but it would be a solution uh for {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : Okay , speech . </s> Industrial Designer : Well , maybe it can be combined with the find the remote control . </s> User Interface : Yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : So um when you add uh speech recognition to your remote control , uh it's very easy to change uh the channel . That's one thing . </s> Project Manager : Yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : And it's very easy uh to find your remote control . </s> Project Manager : To find {disfmarker} yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : So maybe that's a possibility , but I'm afraid it will be a bit costly . </s> Marketing : Yeah . </s> Project Manager : Uh {disfmarker} If if we would um drop the ten digits </s> Industrial Designer : But maybe when we uh {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : but keep the programme and the volume , </s> Industrial Designer : Mm-hmm . </s> Project Manager : because maybe people do not always want to use their voice , um {disfmarker} </s> Industrial Designer : Okay . Okay , okay . </s> Marketing : Especially elder people uh don't like voice recognition . So then we should implement such a but </s> Project Manager : Yeah . But we do focus on younger people . We d it it's a board uh decision . </s> Industrial Designer : Okay . </s> Marketing : Yes . </s> Industrial Designer : Well . I I think it should uh should work , it sh we should manage that . </s> User Interface : So </s> Project Manager : Okay . </s> User Interface : we have to i to make um a decision between the ten digits or the voice recognition . </s> Industrial Designer : Yes .

Um {disfmarker} Just uh press it . </s> Project Manager : {vocalsound} </s> User Interface : Uh yes . Alright . Um well w we uh we had discussed this already in the fin in the previous uh discussion . {vocalsound} Uh the method of the remote control is just {disfmarker} the function of remote control is basically to send messages to the television set .

Well , um according to Ruud , um people do not use um all the extra features very very often . </s> User Interface : Well , the extra functions . </s> Project Manager : So {disfmarker} </s> Marketing : I have the numbers r I have the numbers right here . </s> Project Manager : Okay . </s> Marketing : Well , t uh we won't support teletext which which was the third-most {disfmarker} the second-most used function . </s> User Interface : Used option . </s> Project Manager : Okay . {vocalsound} </s> Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Okay . {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : Well , we we do have a wise board , so I'm not questioning that . {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} </s> User Interface : {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : Uh well {disfmarker} yeah , channel selection is obviously the most important . </s> Project Manager : Yeah .

Yeah . </s> Project Manager : Well , we skip that . </s> Marketing : So {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : Okay . </s> User Interface : Well , so it just th the basic functions .

Well , maybe we can use a light for that . When you move the stick to a to a position , maybe uh a light next to it can lit up .

Yes . </s> User Interface : A stick is v vulnerab vulnerable when it's falling down </s> Project Manager : Yeah , it can break down . </s> Industrial Designer : Hmm . </s> User Interface : or uh </s> Industrial Designer : Yes , yes . </s> User Interface : just a round uh button should be the trick , I think . </s> Marketing : Yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : And {disfmarker} Yes , and this also looks more fancy , I think . </s> User Interface : Yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : I think it it will attract uh more uh uh public , I think . </s> Marketing : A younger uh {disfmarker} Huh . </s> Industrial Designer : But you're the marketing man . </s> Marketing : And it's also quite easy to use , so it'll {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} uh attract younger people because well new , and it might attract older people because it's easy to use . </s> User Interface : Geez .

Okay . </s> User Interface : The ten digits . </s> Industrial Designer : Mm-hmm . </s> Project Manager : Well , for example , that that's what we should think about . {gap} l how is the remote going to look ? Not not in the user interface , but {disfmarker} </s> User Interface : Oh , and just one function . The the the the programme to programme button , the switch to uh two channels , when you have uh something on channel four and something on channel six , just one button which which can uh change </s> Industrial Designer : Mm-hmm . Yes . </s> Project Manager : Yeah . A bit of a split mode . </s> Industrial Designer : Change . </s> Project Manager : Uh l like {disfmarker} Yeah . </s> User Interface : {disfmarker} yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : Yes , yes . </s> Project Manager : Dual channel watch . </s> Industrial Designer : Yes . </s> Project Manager : Okay , well um </s> User Interface : Yeah . </s> Project Manager : m maybe I should write that down . {vocalsound} </s> Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Well {disfmarker} {vocalsound} </s> User Interface : {vocalsound} </s> Industrial Designer : you're the secretary . {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : Uh Ruud , um what's your last name ? </s> Marketing : Mielsen . </s> Project Manager : Mielsen , because I I was writing it down in the last uh {disfmarker} Mielsen . Right . Um I put all the minutes I make into the shared folder . So if you want to have a look at it , you know where to find it . Um {disfmarker} </s> Industrial Designer : Mm okay , </s> User Interface : Alright . </s> Industrial Designer : but make a s make a sub-folder for it , because it's starting to fill up already . {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : Yeah , that's that's {disfmarker} </s> Marketing : Yeah . </s> Project Manager : if you want to do it , Sebastian . {vocalsound} </s> User Interface : {vocalsound} Our B_S_C_ uh W_ uh {disfmarker} </s> Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Sure . {vocalsound} {gap} . {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : Okay , um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Okay , so so um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} uh {disfmarker} </s> User Interface : {vocalsound} {gap} {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : Volume . Programme . Uh dual channel . Uh {disfmarker} </s> Industrial Designer : Yes , that's important . </s> Project Manager : And and do we want um the ten digits ? </s> User Interface : The ten digits ? Yeah , I believe so . </s> Industrial Designer : Well , are are you sure ? </s> Marketing : Well , if you want to go to channel ninety and you have th that button . </s> Industrial Designer : I'm not so sure . </s> User Interface : Yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : Well , that's complicated , </s> Project Manager : Yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : but is that so relevant ? Because I don't think {disfmarker} but you should uh shou you should know that . If it were so . </s> User Interface : I wouldn't buy it personally . A remote control without the ten digits . </s> Industrial Designer : Okay , </s> User Interface : Uh and I think the most {disfmarker} </s> Industrial Designer : I can imagine when </s> Project Manager : I agree actually . {vocalsound} </s> User Interface : Just elder elder people would would buy it , </s> Industrial Designer : I can imagine when you're {disfmarker} when you have a satellite decoder and and you have , well , about six hundred channels , I can imagine you want this . </s> Marketing : Well {disfmarker} </s> User Interface : but {disfmarker} </s> Industrial Designer : But if you're uh a regular T_V_ user , and you just want uh to watch the the Dutch television networks , well , you can uh {disfmarker} {gap} {disfmarker} you can use uh about ten buttons . That's enough . </s> Project Manager : But we do have thirteen different Dutch channels . </s> Marketing : But {disfmarker} </s> User Interface : Yep . The older people only use five of them . </s> Industrial Designer : Well , </s> Marketing : Yeah , </s> Industrial Designer : but how how often do you watch all these channels ? </s> Marketing : and if if we {disfmarker} And if we are targeting at the younger audience , they will probably watch more channels than the older people . </s> Project Manager : Often . </s> Industrial Designer : No , you're probably right . </s> Marketing : So {disfmarker} </s> User Interface : Yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : Okay . But I think these uh ten uh buttons look a bit dull . Don't you think ? </s> Project Manager : Well , it depends on the on the on the looks , on the on the {disfmarker} </s> Industrial Designer : The design . </s> User Interface : On the design . </s> Industrial Designer : Okay . Well , y then there should be {disfmarker} should done {disfmarker} be done something specific with it . </s> Marketing : Well {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : You c {vocalsound} you can d make them very fancy </s> Marketing : And {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : by um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I mean Nokia , they have ten digits on their phones and it still looks very fancy . </s> Industrial Designer : Mm-hmm . </s> Project Manager : So I'm I'm {disfmarker} I do not agree {disfmarker} </s> User Interface : Yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : Okay , so you can experiment by {disfmarker} uh with with shape or with size or with colour , that kind of thing . </s> Project Manager : Exactly , exactly . </s> Industrial Designer : Okay . </s> Marketing : And um there are some numbers about uh speech recognition here that uh younger people would like it . Uh it might be expensive and uh hard to implement , but it would be a solution uh for {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : Okay , speech . </s> Industrial Designer : Well , maybe it can be combined with the find the remote control . </s> User Interface : Yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : So um when you add uh speech recognition to your remote control , uh it's very easy to change uh the channel . That's one thing . </s> Project Manager : Yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : And it's very easy uh to find your remote control . </s> Project Manager : To find {disfmarker} yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : So maybe that's a possibility , but I'm afraid it will be a bit costly . </s> Marketing : Yeah . </s> Project Manager : Uh {disfmarker} If if we would um drop the ten digits </s> Industrial Designer : But maybe when we uh {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : but keep the programme and the volume , </s> Industrial Designer : Mm-hmm . </s> Project Manager : because maybe people do not always want to use their voice , um {disfmarker} </s> Industrial Designer : Okay . Okay , okay . </s> Marketing : Especially elder people uh don't like voice recognition . So then we should implement such a but </s> Project Manager : Yeah . But we do focus on younger people .

Right . Um I put all the minutes I make into the shared folder . So if you want to have a look at it , you know where to find it . Um {disfmarker} </s> Industrial Designer : Mm okay , </s> User Interface : Alright . </s> Industrial Designer : but make a s make a sub-folder for it , because it's starting to fill up already . {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : Yeah , that's that's {disfmarker} </s> Marketing : Yeah . </s> Project Manager : if you want to do it , Sebastian . {vocalsound} </s> User Interface : {vocalsound} Our B_S_C_ uh W_ uh {disfmarker} </s> Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Sure . {vocalsound} {gap} . {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : Okay , um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Okay , so so um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} uh {disfmarker} </s> User Interface : {vocalsound} {gap} {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : Volume .

Yeah , I believe so . </s> Industrial Designer : Well , are are you sure ? </s> Marketing : Well , if you want to go to channel ninety and you have th that button . </s> Industrial Designer : I'm not so sure . </s> User Interface : Yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : Well , that's complicated , </s> Project Manager : Yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : but is that so relevant ? Because I don't think {disfmarker} but you should uh shou you should know that . If it were so . </s> User Interface : I wouldn't buy it personally .

That's enough . </s> Project Manager : But we do have thirteen different Dutch channels . </s> Marketing : But {disfmarker} </s> User Interface : Yep . The older people only use five of them . </s> Industrial Designer : Well , </s> Marketing : Yeah , </s> Industrial Designer : but how how often do you watch all these channels ? </s> Marketing : and if if we {disfmarker} And if we are targeting at the younger audience , they will probably watch more channels than the older people . </s> Project Manager : Often . </s> Industrial Designer : No , you're probably right . </s> Marketing : So {disfmarker} </s> User Interface : Yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : Okay . But I think these uh ten uh buttons look a bit dull . Don't you think ? </s> Project Manager : Well , it depends on the on the on the looks , on the on the {disfmarker} </s> Industrial Designer : The design . </s> User Interface : On the design . </s> Industrial Designer : Okay . Well , y then there should be {disfmarker} should done {disfmarker} be done something specific with it . </s> Marketing : Well {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : You c {vocalsound} you can d make them very fancy </s> Marketing : And {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : by um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I mean Nokia , they have ten digits on their phones and it still looks very fancy . </s> Industrial Designer : Mm-hmm . </s> Project Manager : So I'm I'm {disfmarker} I do not agree {disfmarker} </s> User Interface : Yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : Okay , so you can experiment by {disfmarker} uh with with shape or with size or with colour , that kind of thing . </s> Project Manager : Exactly , exactly . </s> Industrial Designer : Okay . </s> Marketing : And um there are some numbers about uh speech recognition here that uh younger people would like it . Uh it might be expensive and uh hard to implement , but it would be a solution uh for {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : Okay , speech . </s> Industrial Designer : Well , maybe it can be combined with the find the remote control . </s> User Interface : Yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : So um when you add uh speech recognition to your remote control , uh it's very easy to change uh the channel . That's one thing . </s> Project Manager : Yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : And it's very easy uh to find your remote control . </s> Project Manager : To find {disfmarker} yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : So maybe that's a possibility , but I'm afraid it will be a bit costly . </s> Marketing : Yeah . </s> Project Manager : Uh {disfmarker} If if we would um drop the ten digits </s> Industrial Designer : But maybe when we uh {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : but keep the programme and the volume , </s> Industrial Designer : Mm-hmm . </s> Project Manager : because maybe people do not always want to use their voice , um {disfmarker} </s> Industrial Designer : Okay . Okay , okay . </s> Marketing : Especially elder people uh don't like voice recognition . So then we should implement such a but </s> Project Manager : Yeah . But we do focus on younger people . We d it it's a board uh decision . </s> Industrial Designer : Okay . </s> Marketing : Yes . </s> Industrial Designer : Well . I I think it should uh should work , it sh we should manage that . </s> User Interface : So </s> Project Manager : Okay . </s> User Interface : we have to i to make um a decision between the ten digits or the voice recognition . </s> Industrial Designer : Yes . Well , the voice recognition has the main adva has another advantage . It's mas it makes it very easy for us to implement the find uh find the remote control button {disfmarker} uh remote control function . </s> User Interface : Mm-hmm . </s> Project Manager : Okay . </s> Industrial Designer : So that's that's a big advantage , I think . </s> Project Manager : Okay , g good . </s> User Interface : {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : Okay . </s> Industrial Designer : There's only one disadvantage uh by implementing this .

Okay , so on the relevance scale uh the channel selection , the volume selection and the teletext . </s> Marketing : So {disfmarker} Yeah . Yeah . </s> Project Manager : Well , we skip that . </s> Marketing : So {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : Okay . </s> User Interface : Well , so it just th the basic functions . And we don't have to use it for D_V_D_ players uh and all kind of stuff . </s> Industrial Designer : No , no . </s> Project Manager : No . </s> User Interface : So {disfmarker} {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : Nope . </s> Industrial Designer : So that's out of the question . </s> Project Manager : Yeah . </s> User Interface : Yeah .

Yes .

Mm-hmm . Ok like that . Well , I was more thinking about a more elaborate way of controlling , by by these kinds of sticks or something like that . I don't know if if it's user-friendly . That's your field of expertise . </s> Project Manager : But but how does how does the remote uh report uh r uh give back to the user w in what state it is ? </s> User Interface : Yeah , I don't know yet . {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : Because we do not implement uh a user history . </s> Industrial Designer : Mm-hmm . There's {disfmarker} no , but there's no way to do that , because we cannot implement that kind of the system . </s> Project Manager : I know , but but if we use uh like a stick , for example , um {disfmarker} </s> Industrial Designer : W Mm-hmm . Well , maybe we can use a light for that . When you move the stick to a to a position , maybe uh a light next to it can lit up . So you know I've just uh pushed the button , or I changed the channel or t uh turned up the volume . Something like that . </s> Marketing : And if you use that stick for volume control and channel uh selection , you have the m two most important functions in one uh button . </s> Project Manager : Yeah . Uh and we could have other buttons for the for the advanced uh functions . </s> Industrial Designer : Yes . </s> User Interface : But does it {disfmarker} uh I then should n just use uh i instead of the stick , uh like many cell phones , just a round m well , </s> Project Manager : Yeah , draw draw it on the board . </s> User Interface : should we just use a {disfmarker} Um it's already uh {disfmarker} oh , we have a blank . Oh . </s> Industrial Designer : yeah , something like that . Oh </s> User Interface : It's just an easy uh way of of a round button what {disfmarker} which can be pushed in four directions . Instead of a stick . </s> Industrial Designer : It's not really a stick , but {disfmarker} Yes . Yes . </s> User Interface : A stick is v vulnerab vulnerable when it's falling down </s> Project Manager : Yeah , it can break down . </s> Industrial Designer : Hmm . </s> User Interface : or uh </s> Industrial Designer : Yes , yes . </s> User Interface : just a round uh button should be the trick , I think . </s> Marketing : Yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : And {disfmarker} Yes , and this also looks more fancy , I think . </s> User Interface : Yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : I think it it will attract uh more uh uh public , I think . </s> Marketing : A younger uh {disfmarker} Huh . </s> Industrial Designer : But you're the marketing man . </s> Marketing : And it's also quite easy to use , so it'll {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} uh attract younger people because well new , and it might attract older people because it's easy to use . </s> User Interface : Geez . Well , volume and something uh like that . {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : Uh-huh . {vocalsound} </s> User Interface : The programme up and down . {vocalsound} </s> Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : Okay , yeah . </s> User Interface : And the vol yeah , the pen doesn't uh really does what I want . </s> Industrial Designer : Okay , that's good . </s> Project Manager : Okay , but w we still {vocalsound} we're still in the question of uh um uh putting in advanced options .

Sebastian . </s> User Interface : And just about uh the user interface , I came up with um {vocalsound} an easy remote control and an advanced remote control . </s> Project Manager : Yeah . </s> User Interface : What should we choose in in design ? </s> Project Manager : Yeah . Well , um according to Ruud , um people do not use um all the extra features very very often . </s> User Interface : Well , the extra functions . </s> Project Manager : So {disfmarker} </s> Marketing : I have the numbers r I have the numbers right here . </s> Project Manager : Okay . </s> Marketing : Well , t uh we won't support teletext which which was the third-most {disfmarker} the second-most used function . </s> User Interface : Used option . </s> Project Manager : Okay . {vocalsound} </s> Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Okay . {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : Well , we we do have a wise board , so I'm not questioning that . {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} </s> User Interface : {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : Uh well {disfmarker} yeah , channel selection is obviously the most important . </s> Project Manager : Yeah . Okay , so on the relevance scale uh the channel selection , the volume selection and the teletext . </s> Marketing : So {disfmarker} Yeah . Yeah . </s> Project Manager : Well , we skip that . </s> Marketing : So {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : Okay . </s> User Interface : Well , so it just th the basic functions . And we don't have to use it for D_V_D_ players uh and all kind of stuff . </s> Industrial Designer : No , no . </s> Project Manager : No . </s> User Interface : So {disfmarker} {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : Nope . </s> Industrial Designer : So that's out of the question . </s> Project Manager : Yeah . </s> User Interface : Yeah . Just through uh the easy uh design . We can make uh a nice design when when there's not mu uh much buttons in it . </s> Industrial Designer : So {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : Uh uh uh I think we should go for the easier one . </s> Industrial Designer : I think also . Yes . Well , </s> Project Manager : No . </s> User Interface : So {disfmarker} </s> Industrial Designer : we should save costs uh by not implementing a lot of functions and uh the money that we can save from that we should use for uh having a nice design and uh thinking about the user interface </s> Project Manager : Yeah . Okay , </s> Industrial Designer : and {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : Ruud , how do you feel about that ? Uh do you agree , do you think the market would would respond to uh a simple {disfmarker} </s> Marketing : Uh well if we um include other uh innovative functions {disfmarker} {vocalsound} uh then they uh might , </s> Project Manager : Mm-hmm . </s> Marketing : 'cause young people uh like new features . </s> Project Manager : Mm yeah . </s> Marketing : So {disfmarker} </s> Industrial Designer : Yeah , that's right . </s> Project Manager : Okay , so this is is kind of uh {disfmarker} </s> Industrial Designer : Mm . </s> User Interface : Uh just a few buttons , trendy design , nice lightning effects wh and the sound . </s> Industrial Designer : Okay . Well , is it {disfmarker} maybe there's another possibility . You can make it look like an easy s piece of equipment , but it's quite elaborated , uh because it has many functions . </s> Project Manager : Yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : Maybe it's more important to make the {disfmarker} make it look like a very uh friendly , easy to catch piece of equipment , but um nevertheless {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : But but are we not in in the in the manual uh {disfmarker} I mean if you have few buttons , no display , um I mean uh I guess it's l it's working with with a shift functions and um one button can uh </s> Industrial Designer : Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Ok like that . Well , I was more thinking about a more elaborate way of controlling , by by these kinds of sticks or something like that . I don't know if if it's user-friendly . That's your field of expertise . </s> Project Manager : But but how does how does the remote uh report uh r uh give back to the user w in what state it is ? </s> User Interface : Yeah , I don't know yet . {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : Because we do not implement uh a user history . </s> Industrial Designer : Mm-hmm . There's {disfmarker} no , but there's no way to do that , because we cannot implement that kind of the system . </s> Project Manager : I know , but but if we use uh like a stick , for example , um {disfmarker} </s> Industrial Designer : W Mm-hmm . Well , maybe we can use a light for that . When you move the stick to a to a position , maybe uh a light next to it can lit up . So you know I've just uh pushed the button , or I changed the channel or t uh turned up the volume . Something like that . </s> Marketing : And if you use that stick for volume control and channel uh selection , you have the m two most important functions in one uh button . </s> Project Manager : Yeah . Uh and we could have other buttons for the for the advanced uh functions . </s> Industrial Designer : Yes . </s> User Interface : But does it {disfmarker} uh I then should n just use uh i instead of the stick , uh like many cell phones , just a round m well , </s> Project Manager : Yeah , draw draw it on the board . </s> User Interface : should we just use a {disfmarker} Um it's already uh {disfmarker} oh , we have a blank . Oh . </s> Industrial Designer : yeah , something like that . Oh </s> User Interface : It's just an easy uh way of of a round button what {disfmarker} which can be pushed in four directions . Instead of a stick . </s> Industrial Designer : It's not really a stick , but {disfmarker} Yes . Yes . </s> User Interface : A stick is v vulnerab vulnerable when it's falling down </s> Project Manager : Yeah , it can break down . </s> Industrial Designer : Hmm . </s> User Interface : or uh </s> Industrial Designer : Yes , yes . </s> User Interface : just a round uh button should be the trick , I think . </s> Marketing : Yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : And {disfmarker} Yes , and this also looks more fancy , I think . </s> User Interface : Yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : I think it it will attract uh more uh uh public , I think . </s> Marketing : A younger uh {disfmarker} Huh . </s> Industrial Designer : But you're the marketing man . </s> Marketing : And it's also quite easy to use , so it'll {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} uh attract younger people because well new , and it might attract older people because it's easy to use . </s> User Interface : Geez . Well , volume and something uh like that . {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : Uh-huh . {vocalsound} </s> User Interface : The programme up and down . {vocalsound} </s> Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : Okay , yeah . </s> User Interface : And the vol yeah , the pen doesn't uh really does what I want . </s> Industrial Designer : Okay , that's good . </s> Project Manager : Okay , but w we still {vocalsound} we're still in the question of uh um uh putting in advanced options . Um Ruud just told us um the market is interested in some advanced uh new techniques . Um however , uh keeping it simple is is important for the costs and all all those kind of things . We need to find a balance between uh the advanced techniques and and the user-friendliness . </s> Industrial Designer : Mm-hmm . </s> User Interface : But I think our our next step to look at is just that . So I don't think it's {disfmarker} um we have something to do . Uh we can't discuss it right now , because n no one of us have {disfmarker} has the information to discuss about that , I think . </s> Project Manager : Um well , for {disfmarker} we do have to uh decide this this meeting . Yeah . </s> User Interface : Yes ? </s> Project Manager : We need to um have the uh the user function {disfmarker} uh the functions decided and um {vocalsound} uh our target audience . </s> User Interface : Mm-hmm . </s> Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Okay . </s> User Interface : but teletext is so uh is just scrapped . 'Kay , </s> Industrial Designer : Okay . Do do you want a list of functions ? Do you want an explicit list ? Uh which uh incorporates all function available on the device ? </s> Project Manager : Um well , I do not want a full uh {disfmarker} it's not necessary to to have a full list , but I want um the kind of functions , for example uh th the most important are volume and uh programme selecting . </s> Industrial Designer : Okay . Okay . </s> User Interface : The ten digits . </s> Industrial Designer : Mm-hmm . </s> Project Manager : Well , for example , that that's what we should think about . {gap} l how is the remote going to look ? Not not in the user interface , but {disfmarker} </s> User Interface : Oh , and just one function . The the the the programme to programme button , the switch to uh two channels , when you have uh something on channel four and something on channel six , just one button which which can uh change </s> Industrial Designer : Mm-hmm . Yes . </s> Project Manager : Yeah . A bit of a split mode . </s> Industrial Designer : Change . </s> Project Manager : Uh l like {disfmarker} Yeah . </s> User Interface : {disfmarker} yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : Yes , yes . </s> Project Manager : Dual channel watch . </s> Industrial Designer : Yes . </s> Project Manager : Okay , well um </s> User Interface : Yeah . </s> Project Manager : m maybe I should write that down . {vocalsound} </s> Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Well {disfmarker} {vocalsound} </s> User Interface : {vocalsound} </s> Industrial Designer : you're the secretary . {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : Uh Ruud , um what's your last name ? </s> Marketing : Mielsen . </s> Project Manager : Mielsen , because I I was writing it down in the last uh {disfmarker} Mielsen . Right . Um I put all the minutes I make into the shared folder . So if you want to have a look at it , you know where to find it . Um {disfmarker} </s> Industrial Designer : Mm okay , </s> User Interface : Alright . </s> Industrial Designer : but make a s make a sub-folder for it , because it's starting to fill up already . {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : Yeah , that's that's {disfmarker} </s> Marketing : Yeah . </s> Project Manager : if you want to do it , Sebastian . {vocalsound} </s> User Interface : {vocalsound} Our B_S_C_ uh W_ uh {disfmarker} </s> Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Sure . {vocalsound} {gap} . {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : Okay , um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Okay , so so um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} uh {disfmarker} </s> User Interface : {vocalsound} {gap} {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : Volume . Programme . Uh dual channel . Uh {disfmarker} </s> Industrial Designer : Yes , that's important . </s> Project Manager : And and do we want um the ten digits ? </s> User Interface : The ten digits ? Yeah , I believe so . </s> Industrial Designer : Well , are are you sure ? </s> Marketing : Well , if you want to go to channel ninety and you have th that button . </s> Industrial Designer : I'm not so sure . </s> User Interface : Yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : Well , that's complicated , </s> Project Manager : Yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : but is that so relevant ? Because I don't think {disfmarker} but you should uh shou you should know that . If it were so . </s> User Interface : I wouldn't buy it personally . A remote control without the ten digits . </s> Industrial Designer : Okay , </s> User Interface : Uh and I think the most {disfmarker} </s> Industrial Designer : I can imagine when </s> Project Manager : I agree actually . {vocalsound} </s> User Interface : Just elder elder people would would buy it , </s> Industrial Designer : I can imagine when you're {disfmarker} when you have a satellite decoder and and you have , well , about six hundred channels , I can imagine you want this . </s> Marketing : Well {disfmarker} </s> User Interface : but {disfmarker} </s> Industrial Designer : But if you're uh a regular T_V_ user , and you just want uh to watch the the Dutch television networks , well , you can uh {disfmarker} {gap} {disfmarker} you can use uh about ten buttons . That's enough . </s> Project Manager : But we do have thirteen different Dutch channels . </s> Marketing : But {disfmarker} </s> User Interface : Yep . The older people only use five of them . </s> Industrial Designer : Well , </s> Marketing : Yeah , </s> Industrial Designer : but how how often do you watch all these channels ? </s> Marketing : and if if we {disfmarker} And if we are targeting at the younger audience , they will probably watch more channels than the older people . </s> Project Manager : Often . </s> Industrial Designer : No , you're probably right . </s> Marketing : So {disfmarker} </s> User Interface : Yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : Okay . But I think these uh ten uh buttons look a bit dull . Don't you think ? </s> Project Manager : Well , it depends on the on the on the looks , on the on the {disfmarker} </s> Industrial Designer : The design . </s> User Interface : On the design . </s> Industrial Designer : Okay . Well , y then there should be {disfmarker} should done {disfmarker} be done something specific with it . </s> Marketing : Well {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : You c {vocalsound} you can d make them very fancy </s> Marketing : And {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : by um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I mean Nokia , they have ten digits on their phones and it still looks very fancy . </s> Industrial Designer : Mm-hmm . </s> Project Manager : So I'm I'm {disfmarker} I do not agree {disfmarker} </s> User Interface : Yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : Okay , so you can experiment by {disfmarker} uh with with shape or with size or with colour , that kind of thing . </s> Project Manager : Exactly , exactly . </s> Industrial Designer : Okay . </s> Marketing : And um there are some numbers about uh speech recognition here that uh younger people would like it . Uh it might be expensive and uh hard to implement , but it would be a solution uh for {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : Okay , speech . </s> Industrial Designer : Well , maybe it can be combined with the find the remote control . </s> User Interface : Yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : So um when you add uh speech recognition to your remote control , uh it's very easy to change uh the channel . That's one thing . </s> Project Manager : Yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : And it's very easy uh to find your remote control . </s> Project Manager : To find {disfmarker} yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : So maybe that's a possibility , but I'm afraid it will be a bit costly . </s> Marketing : Yeah . </s> Project Manager : Uh {disfmarker} If if we would um drop the ten digits </s> Industrial Designer : But maybe when we uh {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : but keep the programme and the volume , </s> Industrial Designer : Mm-hmm . </s> Project Manager : because maybe people do not always want to use their voice , um {disfmarker} </s> Industrial Designer : Okay . Okay , okay . </s> Marketing : Especially elder people uh don't like voice recognition . So then we should implement such a but </s> Project Manager : Yeah . But we do focus on younger people . We d it it's a board uh decision . </s> Industrial Designer : Okay . </s> Marketing : Yes . </s> Industrial Designer : Well . I I think it should uh should work , it sh we should manage that . </s> User Interface : So </s> Project Manager : Okay . </s> User Interface : we have to i to make um a decision between the ten digits or the voice recognition . </s> Industrial Designer : Yes . Well , the voice recognition has the main adva has another advantage . It's mas it makes it very easy for us to implement the find uh find the remote control button {disfmarker} uh remote control function . </s> User Interface : Mm-hmm . </s> Project Manager : Okay . </s> Industrial Designer : So that's that's a big advantage , I think . </s> Project Manager : Okay , g good . </s> User Interface : {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : Okay . </s> Industrial Designer : There's only one disadvantage uh by implementing this .

Uh . </s> Project Manager : Okay . So what do we think this remote control should {disfmarker} Five minutes . </s> Marketing : Oh dear . </s> Project Manager : Till the meeting {disfmarker} oh right . This is what we have left . Um , oh we just {gap} </s> User Interface : I also think though that it shouldn't have too many buttons , </s> Industrial Designer : Yeah , I agree . </s> User Interface : 'cause I hate that when they have too many buttons and {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : Yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} B_ button and the F_ button , they don't do anything . </s> Marketing : Yeah , yeah yeah . </s> User Interface : I mean I know it has to have enough functions but like , I don't know you , just have like eight thousand buttons and you're like , no , you never use half of them .

Uh . </s> Project Manager : s y yeah but you can programme , so you can programme like your favourite channels , so like if you had a s </s> Marketing : But , would you have the screen on the thing , or would you have it on the telly transmitting the screen . </s> Project Manager : That's something we could decide . Mm . </s> Marketing : Because {disfmarker} </s> User Interface : I guess they would go together somehow ? I dunno . </s> Marketing : Because , I don't know if it's {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I think it's e expensive , if you have {disfmarker} if you use the telly screen , 'cause the telly's already a screen , then you can pro sort of have a programming function , really easy sort of arrow up and down , on the remote , </s> Project Manager : Yeah . Yeah . </s> Marketing : and then use the telly as a screen . </s> Project Manager : Right . </s> Marketing : But um {disfmarker} </s> User Interface : I'm thinking kind of {disfmarker} </s> Marketing : But yeah for sure . Something like not {disfmarker} it's not on the button but it's telling you what to do , </s> Project Manager : Yeah . </s> Marketing : is that what you mean ? </s> Project Manager : Yeah . </s> Marketing : Right . Mm . </s> User Interface : Or like you h you see those you know people {disfmarker} I'm thinking of like celebrity cribs kind of things when like they have all those {disfmarker} these things that at their house you know {disfmarker} their their entire house is so electronic , and they have like this one master control that {disfmarker} and it's like a hand held like {disfmarker} turns on everything sort of control and it has like a screen and like {disfmarker} so I think it should be possible to have some kind of a screen , I don't know if {disfmarker} it must be {disfmarker} it would probably {disfmarker} </s> Marketing : Yeah . </s> User Interface : must be ex too expensive though t like I dunno . </s> Project Manager : Mm . </s> Marketing : But like mobile phones have screens and they're cheap . </s> User Interface : Yeah , yeah .

Yeah . </s> Marketing : In which case you're going to be l but if it has a sort of signal which isn't any sound {disfmarker} </s> User Interface : Yeah . </s> Marketing : I don't know if it's expensive maybe to {disfmarker} </s> User Interface : I don't {disfmarker} yeah I mean it {disfmarker} but like I mean {disfmarker} </s> Marketing : Maybe call is enough .

Yeah . </s> Project Manager : What if it had something like um just like a magnet on the back of it and you could {disfmarker} I mean j just to have some place to put it besides like a base .

Um {disfmarker} </s> Marketing : Well the p the most important function is easy to use . The the zapping , channel switching , volume .

I mean ease of use um does not only apply to the most basic functions . </s> Industrial Designer : Okay . </s> Project Manager : It's the uh it's it's overall . Is the device easy to use ? </s> Industrial Designer : Yeah , that's right . You're right in that , but I {gap} {disfmarker} I guess uh an advanced user will will find the voice recognition function easy to use , </s> Project Manager : Yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : because he is already {disfmarker} he or she is already an advanced user . </s> Project Manager : Yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : So {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : Um {disfmarker} Okay . </s> Industrial Designer : After all , I think {disfmarker} personally I would give a two . But {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : Uh Roo , a three ? </s> User Interface : Yep . </s> Project Manager : Ruud ? </s> Marketing : Good question . Uh I'll go uh for the two . </s> Project Manager : Okay . {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} </s> User Interface : {vocalsound} </s> Industrial Designer : So , it's two , two and three . Two threes . So that's ten . </s> Project Manager : So I could make it e easy ? </s> User Interface : If you make it a four it will be three in general . </s> Industrial Designer : So that's w No , two and a half . </s> User Interface : If he makes it a four . Not a three . </s> Industrial Designer : Six and four . Six and four is ten . Divided by four is two and a half . So {disfmarker} </s> User Interface : Darn . Nee . </s> Industrial Designer : Yes . {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : Hmm ? Huh ? </s> Project Manager : Roo . {vocalsound} </s> User Interface : A seven , a three {disfmarker} {vocalsound} No . </s> Marketing : Yeah . I yeah {gap} . </s> User Interface : A four and a three together . </s> Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Four ? </s> User Interface : Yeah , you have a two , he has a two .

I know . </s> Marketing : No . {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : Okay , but if I would say a three , then it's six , and four is ten . Divided by four is two point five . </s> Industrial Designer : Divided by four . </s> User Interface : Yes . So if you want to have the conclusion as a three {disfmarker} three . Then you would make a four . If you fill out a four {disfmarker} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : But I'm filling in a three . </s> Industrial Designer : That's not even {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : Does it {disfmarker} will {disfmarker} so it will be a two point five . </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} </s> Industrial Designer : But that's not possible to fill in , </s> Project Manager : Yes , it is . </s> Industrial Designer : so we have to round it . {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} Is it easy to find ? {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : {vocalsound} I have a veto . {vocalsound} Exactly . It's not about the content , it's about {disfmarker} okay , um is it easy to f Yeah , definitely . </s> User Interface : Yeah , </s> Industrial Designer : Yes . </s> User Interface : we haven't re uh re uh really worked it out , but you c you can you can just say find and he repeats find . </s> Industrial Designer : It it most definitely is {disfmarker} it's very easy . </s> Project Manager : Yeah , or beeps or {disfmarker} yeah . </s> User Interface : Yeah , but that's the that's the the basic idea of the the speaker uh {disfmarker} </s> Industrial Designer : Yes . Maybe {disfmarker} Uh I I think I think {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : I'm here , I'm here . {vocalsound} </s> Industrial Designer : something like that . Maybe you have to uh programme it once , so to that l respond to uh a certain word or a certain sentence , something like where are you , and then it will sing I'm here . So something like that . </s> Project Manager : Yeah . Yeah . </s> User Interface : But even without it {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : Yeah . </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : Well , I uh {disfmarker} </s> Industrial Designer : So , I th </s> Project Manager : we should not uh stay too long on this subject uh because of the time , but I personally give it a one . </s> User Interface : Yeah . </s> Project Manager : Um Sebastian ? </s> Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Yeah , me too . </s> User Interface : Me too . </s> Marketing : Yeah , I agree . </s> Project Manager : Right , well . The feel of the remote control is spongy . Well , uh </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : it can't be more spongy . So {disfmarker} {vocalsound} </s> Industrial Designer : Well , it can be . There are cases um in which the outside casing is {disfmarker} um can be {disfmarker} uh how d how do you prono is is moldable . </s> User Interface : Was it one of our options ? </s> Industrial Designer : No , it's not one of our option , </s> Marketing : No . Uh </s> Project Manager : No okay , but but </s> User Interface : So , in the in {disfmarker} </s> Industrial Designer : but when you look in the market , when you look {disfmarker} </s> Marketing : this this was a most spongy option . {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : for the options given , it's the most spongy one . </s> Industrial Designer : Uh yes , </s> User Interface : Yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : but that's not that's not uh what they are talking about , I think . Because we compare all these uh characteristics {disfmarker} characteristics with uh market {disfmarker} uh with with the real market . </s> Project Manager : Yeah . Yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : So there are uh remote controls out there which are a lot more spongy . They're out there . {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : {vocalsound} They're out there . {vocalsound} </s> User Interface : {vocalsound} But I think in this case in this case we've done the best we could . </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : Yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : Yes , but it's not good enough , </s> Project Manager : {vocalsound} I'll give it a one . </s> Industrial Designer : so it's a two . </s> User Interface : {vocalsound} {vocalsound} I wan I'll take one . </s> Industrial Designer : You take one ?

I think it's innovative . </s> Project Manager : Yeah . </s> User Interface : {vocalsound} And the scroll uh wheel . The solar {disfmarker} not many remotes have the solar , I think . </s> Industrial Designer : No . It could have been a little bit more innovative u by using the kinetic uh energy source , but it's it's way too {disfmarker} </s> Marketing : Yeah , and uh {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : That would have been a thrill . </s> Industrial Designer : yes , but {disfmarker} </s> Marketing : So uh also a uh two ? </s> Industrial Designer : I think uh it's a two . </s> Project Manager : Yep . </s> Marketing : Is it easy to use ? </s> Project Manager : I'm not sure . {vocalsound} I'm not sure . </s> User Interface : Yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} </s> User Interface : Well yeah , the voice recognition of course is hard to learn , I think . Well , hard {disfmarker} it's not for the for the e for the elderly . They won't use it . </s> Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Well , but there are two parts in this remote control . What you see here is is the basic part . Everybody can use it , so that's easy to use . </s> Project Manager : Yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : That's for a novice user . When you have a more advanced , elaborate user , well , such a user really would like to explore all these additional functions . So in that in that way it is advanced , </s> Project Manager : Yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : and I think it's easy to use for for both uh types of users . </s> User Interface : I think {disfmarker} I think a three . </s> Industrial Designer : So uh {disfmarker} It's maybe {disfmarker} it's not very uh easy for {disfmarker} </s> User Interface : {vocalsound} Wouldn't give it more . </s> Project Manager : Uh I'm doubting {disfmarker} doubting as well . Um {disfmarker} </s> Marketing : Well the p the most important function is easy to use . The the zapping , channel switching , volume . But the more advanced functions are probably a bit harder . </s> Project Manager : Okay . Uh two or three ? Three ? Wha wh what would be your guess ? I mean ease of use um does not only apply to the most basic functions . </s> Industrial Designer : Okay . </s> Project Manager : It's the uh it's it's overall . Is the device easy to use ? </s> Industrial Designer : Yeah , that's right . You're right in that , but I {gap} {disfmarker} I guess uh an advanced user will will find the voice recognition function easy to use , </s> Project Manager : Yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : because he is already {disfmarker} he or she is already an advanced user . </s> Project Manager : Yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : So {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : Um {disfmarker} Okay . </s> Industrial Designer : After all , I think {disfmarker} personally I would give a two . But {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : Uh Roo , a three ? </s> User Interface : Yep . </s> Project Manager : Ruud ? </s> Marketing : Good question . Uh I'll go uh for the two . </s> Project Manager : Okay . {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} </s> User Interface : {vocalsound} </s> Industrial Designer : So , it's two , two and three . Two threes . So that's ten . </s> Project Manager : So I could make it e easy ? </s> User Interface : If you make it a four it will be three in general . </s> Industrial Designer : So that's w No , two and a half . </s> User Interface : If he makes it a four . Not a three . </s> Industrial Designer : Six and four . Six and four is ten . Divided by four is two and a half . So {disfmarker} </s> User Interface : Darn . Nee . </s> Industrial Designer : Yes . {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : Hmm ? Huh ? </s> Project Manager : Roo . {vocalsound} </s> User Interface : A seven , a three {disfmarker} {vocalsound} No . </s> Marketing : Yeah . I yeah {gap} . </s> User Interface : A four and a three together . </s> Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Four ? </s> User Interface : Yeah , you have a two , he has a two . Three ? </s> Marketing : Yeah , </s> Industrial Designer : Two ? </s> Marketing : two , two , three {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : No , </s> User Interface : And a three ? </s> Project Manager : I haven't said anything yet . </s> User Interface : Nee . I know . </s> Marketing : No . {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : Okay , but if I would say a three , then it's six , and four is ten . Divided by four is two point five . </s> Industrial Designer : Divided by four . </s> User Interface : Yes . So if you want to have the conclusion as a three {disfmarker} three . Then you would make a four . If you fill out a four {disfmarker} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : But I'm filling in a three . </s> Industrial Designer : That's not even {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : Does it {disfmarker} will {disfmarker} so it will be a two point five . </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} </s> Industrial Designer : But that's not possible to fill in , </s> Project Manager : Yes , it is . </s> Industrial Designer : so we have to round it . {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} Is it easy to find ? {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : {vocalsound} I have a veto . {vocalsound} Exactly . It's not about the content , it's about {disfmarker} okay , um is it easy to f Yeah , definitely . </s> User Interface : Yeah , </s> Industrial Designer : Yes . </s> User Interface : we haven't re uh re uh really worked it out , but you c you can you can just say find and he repeats find . </s> Industrial Designer : It it most definitely is {disfmarker} it's very easy . </s> Project Manager : Yeah , or beeps or {disfmarker} yeah . </s> User Interface : Yeah , but that's the that's the the basic idea of the the speaker uh {disfmarker} </s> Industrial Designer : Yes . Maybe {disfmarker} Uh I I think I think {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : I'm here , I'm here . {vocalsound} </s> Industrial Designer : something like that . Maybe you have to uh programme it once , so to that l respond to uh a certain word or a certain sentence , something like where are you , and then it will sing I'm here . So something like that . </s> Project Manager : Yeah . Yeah . </s> User Interface : But even without it {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : Yeah . </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : Well , I uh {disfmarker} </s> Industrial Designer : So , I th </s> Project Manager : we should not uh stay too long on this subject uh because of the time , but I personally give it a one . </s> User Interface : Yeah . </s> Project Manager : Um Sebastian ? </s> Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Yeah , me too . </s> User Interface : Me too . </s> Marketing : Yeah , I agree . </s> Project Manager : Right , well . The feel of the remote control is spongy . Well , uh </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : it can't be more spongy . So {disfmarker} {vocalsound} </s> Industrial Designer : Well , it can be . There are cases um in which the outside casing is {disfmarker} um can be {disfmarker} uh how d how do you prono is is moldable . </s> User Interface : Was it one of our options ? </s> Industrial Designer : No , it's not one of our option , </s> Marketing : No . Uh </s> Project Manager : No okay , but but </s> User Interface : So , in the in {disfmarker} </s> Industrial Designer : but when you look in the market , when you look {disfmarker} </s> Marketing : this this was a most spongy option . {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : for the options given , it's the most spongy one . </s> Industrial Designer : Uh yes , </s> User Interface : Yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : but that's not that's not uh what they are talking about , I think . Because we compare all these uh characteristics {disfmarker} characteristics with uh market {disfmarker} uh with with the real market . </s> Project Manager : Yeah . Yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : So there are uh remote controls out there which are a lot more spongy . They're out there . {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : {vocalsound} They're out there . {vocalsound} </s> User Interface : {vocalsound} But I think in this case in this case we've done the best we could . </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : Yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : Yes , but it's not good enough , </s> Project Manager : {vocalsound} I'll give it a one . </s> Industrial Designer : so it's a two . </s> User Interface : {vocalsound} {vocalsound} I wan I'll take one . </s> Industrial Designer : You take one ? What do you give it ? </s> Marketing : Well yeah , it depends , 'cause it's the most spongy we could {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : Yeah , I know , but you have to name a fig uh a number . {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : but {disfmarker} yeah . </s> Project Manager : Because we need to go on {disfmarker} in {disfmarker} for the time . </s> Marketing : Well , if I give it a one there'll be one hell of a calculation . </s> User Interface : It will be a one . {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : So I'll just give it a two and make this a one point five . </s> Industrial Designer : No no no . Uh I'll I'll change it , I'll make it m my my mark will be a four . {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : {vocalsound} You are {disfmarker} </s> User Interface : {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : okay . </s> User Interface : {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : The remote control offers enough features . </s> User Interface : {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : Well , Ruud , what what do you think about it ? </s> Marketing : Well , the basic layout doesn't offem {disfmarker} offer much , but the voice recognition could add a lot .

When you have a more advanced , elaborate user , well , such a user really would like to explore all these additional functions . So in that in that way it is advanced , </s> Project Manager : Yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : and I think it's easy to use for for both uh types of users . </s> User Interface : I think {disfmarker} I think a three . </s> Industrial Designer : So uh {disfmarker} It's maybe {disfmarker} it's not very uh easy for {disfmarker} </s> User Interface : {vocalsound} Wouldn't give it more . </s> Project Manager : Uh I'm doubting {disfmarker} doubting as well . Um {disfmarker} </s> Marketing : Well the p the most important function is easy to use . The the zapping , channel switching , volume . But the more advanced functions are probably a bit harder . </s> Project Manager : Okay . Uh two or three ? Three ? Wha wh what would be your guess ? I mean ease of use um does not only apply to the most basic functions . </s> Industrial Designer : Okay . </s> Project Manager : It's the uh it's it's overall . Is the device easy to use ? </s> Industrial Designer : Yeah , that's right . You're right in that , but I {gap} {disfmarker} I guess uh an advanced user will will find the voice recognition function easy to use , </s> Project Manager : Yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : because he is already {disfmarker} he or she is already an advanced user . </s> Project Manager : Yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : So {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : Um {disfmarker} Okay . </s> Industrial Designer : After all , I think {disfmarker} personally I would give a two . But {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : Uh Roo , a three ? </s> User Interface : Yep . </s> Project Manager : Ruud ? </s> Marketing : Good question . Uh I'll go uh for the two . </s> Project Manager : Okay . {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} </s> User Interface : {vocalsound} </s> Industrial Designer : So , it's two , two and three . Two threes . So that's ten . </s> Project Manager : So I could make it e easy ? </s> User Interface : If you make it a four it will be three in general . </s> Industrial Designer : So that's w No , two and a half . </s> User Interface : If he makes it a four . Not a three . </s> Industrial Designer : Six and four . Six and four is ten . Divided by four is two and a half . So {disfmarker} </s> User Interface : Darn .

Huh ? </s> Project Manager : Roo . {vocalsound} </s> User Interface : A seven , a three {disfmarker} {vocalsound} No . </s> Marketing : Yeah . I yeah {gap} . </s> User Interface : A four and a three together . </s> Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Four ? </s> User Interface : Yeah , you have a two , he has a two . Three ? </s> Marketing : Yeah , </s> Industrial Designer : Two ? </s> Marketing : two , two , three {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : No , </s> User Interface : And a three ? </s> Project Manager : I haven't said anything yet . </s> User Interface : Nee . I know . </s> Marketing : No . {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : Okay , but if I would say a three , then it's six , and four is ten . Divided by four is two point five . </s> Industrial Designer : Divided by four . </s> User Interface : Yes . So if you want to have the conclusion as a three {disfmarker} three . Then you would make a four . If you fill out a four {disfmarker} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : But I'm filling in a three . </s> Industrial Designer : That's not even {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : Does it {disfmarker} will {disfmarker} so it will be a two point five . </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} </s> Industrial Designer : But that's not possible to fill in , </s> Project Manager : Yes , it is . </s> Industrial Designer : so we have to round it . {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} Is it easy to find ? {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : {vocalsound} I have a veto . {vocalsound} Exactly .

Maybe {disfmarker} Uh I I think I think {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : I'm here , I'm here . {vocalsound} </s> Industrial Designer : something like that . Maybe you have to uh programme it once , so to that l respond to uh a certain word or a certain sentence , something like where are you , and then it will sing I'm here . So something like that . </s> Project Manager : Yeah . Yeah . </s> User Interface : But even without it {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : Yeah . </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : Well , I uh {disfmarker} </s> Industrial Designer : So , I th </s> Project Manager : we should not uh stay too long on this subject uh because of the time , but I personally give it a one . </s> User Interface : Yeah . </s> Project Manager : Um Sebastian ? </s> Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Yeah , me too . </s> User Interface : Me too . </s> Marketing : Yeah , I agree . </s> Project Manager : Right , well . The feel of the remote control is spongy . Well , uh </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : it can't be more spongy . So {disfmarker} {vocalsound} </s> Industrial Designer : Well , it can be . There are cases um in which the outside casing is {disfmarker} um can be {disfmarker} uh how d how do you prono is is moldable . </s> User Interface : Was it one of our options ? </s> Industrial Designer : No , it's not one of our option , </s> Marketing : No . Uh </s> Project Manager : No okay , but but </s> User Interface : So , in the in {disfmarker} </s> Industrial Designer : but when you look in the market , when you look {disfmarker} </s> Marketing : this this was a most spongy option . {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : for the options given , it's the most spongy one . </s> Industrial Designer : Uh yes , </s> User Interface : Yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : but that's not that's not uh what they are talking about , I think . Because we compare all these uh characteristics {disfmarker} characteristics with uh market {disfmarker} uh with with the real market . </s> Project Manager : Yeah . Yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : So there are uh remote controls out there which are a lot more spongy . They're out there . {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : {vocalsound} They're out there . {vocalsound} </s> User Interface : {vocalsound} But I think in this case in this case we've done the best we could . </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : Yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : Yes , but it's not good enough , </s> Project Manager : {vocalsound} I'll give it a one . </s> Industrial Designer : so it's a two . </s> User Interface : {vocalsound} {vocalsound} I wan I'll take one . </s> Industrial Designer : You take one ? What do you give it ? </s> Marketing : Well yeah , it depends , 'cause it's the most spongy we could {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : Yeah , I know , but you have to name a fig uh a number . {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : but {disfmarker} yeah . </s> Project Manager : Because we need to go on {disfmarker} in {disfmarker} for the time . </s> Marketing : Well , if I give it a one there'll be one hell of a calculation . </s> User Interface : It will be a one . {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : So I'll just give it a two and make this a one point five . </s> Industrial Designer : No no no . Uh I'll I'll change it , I'll make it m my my mark will be a four . {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : {vocalsound} You are {disfmarker} </s> User Interface : {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : okay . </s> User Interface : {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : The remote control offers enough features . </s> User Interface : {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : Well , Ruud , what what do you think about it ? </s> Marketing : Well , the basic layout doesn't offem {disfmarker} offer much , but the voice recognition could add a lot . So {disfmarker} </s> Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Basically it's it's completely programmable . </s> Marketing : Yeah , depends . </s> Project Manager : Yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : You can add very m much functionality by uh using the voice recognition mode . </s> Project Manager : Yeah , I know . </s> Industrial Designer : So it's quite advanced . </s> Project Manager : What what we didn't talk about is um uh {disfmarker} </s> User Interface : Yeah , but {vocalsound} it ha doesn't has the digits . I believe it's {disfmarker} If you uh ask yourself it offers enough features , I don't I don't think it is {disfmarker} it has all the features um a normal remote has . </s> Project Manager : I think it has . </s> Marketing : Uh depends on what you uh implement in the speech feat </s> Project Manager : Yeah . Bec because you can um {disfmarker} we didn't talk about it , but you do have uh remote controls that are able to adapt another signal . So , </s> Industrial Designer : Yes . </s> Project Manager : you place a a regular uh remote control in front of the other one , hit the one or the two or the three , whatever , and it r records the uh the um {gap} {disfmarker} the the signals . </s> Industrial Designer : Has uh the signals sent to it . </s> User Interface : Yeah . </s> Marketing : Signal . </s> Project Manager : So you could uh uh uh enter any comment you like , as long it's able to {disfmarker} as long as our device is able to reproduce the infrared signal . So I think th this uh this is uh a a remote control with a very high level of features . </s> Industrial Designer : Absolutely . </s> Project Manager : Although there are i a few buttons , but the inside is is quite uh advanced . </s> Industrial Designer : Yes . But that {disfmarker} that's its power , I guess , because uh a regular programmable uh remote control contains , well , uh really a lot of buttons . At at least uh forty buttons . </s> Project Manager : Yeah . Yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : So it's it's quite s complicated to get uh to get used to . And this is quite s simple . </s> Project Manager : Yep . </s> Industrial Designer : You can use your voice to to programme it . It's {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : Yeah . Okay , um let's give it a number . I'll give it uh a one . For for the {disfmarker} for this t uh type of market , I think it's a one . </s> User Interface : I'll give a two . </s> Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Yeah , I'll give it a one . </s> Marketing : Um I think think a one , 'cause {gap} v with a voice recognition you could add anything you want , so that's like um {disfmarker} </s> Industrial Designer : Yes . I I've {disfmarker} I think we've uh succe succeed in in developing a product that's actually quite good , but not for this kind of market , and not for this kind of price . </s> User Interface : {vocalsound} {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : Yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : So {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : So high quality , low acceptance . </s> Industrial Designer : Hmm .",

Is it ? Is it fancy ? </s> Project Manager : Yeah , I think so . </s> User Interface : Um the yellow rubber , I think so . </s> Industrial Designer : I think so . </s> Project Manager : {vocalsound} You like the rubber , uh Roo . {vocalsound} </s> User Interface : {vocalsound} I'm into it . {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} </s> Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : So uh one ? </s> Project Manager : Yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : But it's not that fancy . </s> Project Manager : No , I'll I'll I'll give it a two . </s> Industrial Designer : I mean I think uh {disfmarker} I think it would have been more fancy if we used the titanium housing {disfmarker} the casing .

Is it ? Is it fancy ? </s> Project Manager : Yeah , I think so . </s> User Interface : Um the yellow rubber , I think so . </s> Industrial Designer : I think so . </s> Project Manager : {vocalsound} You like the rubber , uh Roo . {vocalsound} </s> User Interface : {vocalsound} I'm into it . {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} </s> Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : So uh one ? </s> Project Manager : Yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : But it's not that fancy . </s> Project Manager : No , I'll I'll I'll give it a two . </s> Industrial Designer : I mean I think uh {disfmarker} I think it would have been more fancy if we used the titanium housing {disfmarker} the casing .

It {disfmarker} yeah . </s> User Interface : Well , just {vocalsound} give it a two . </s> Industrial Designer : Okay . </s> Project Manager : Yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : Yes . </s> User Interface : It's not the ultimate uh fancy two , but {disfmarker} </s> Industrial Designer : I think I th I think it would have been {disfmarker} I would have think {disfmarker} uh it could have been more fancy by using the double-curved case . It would have been even more fancy , but we decided not to , because if we use a double-curved case , we could not use solar . </s> User Interface : Yeah , but that's sti that's uh {disfmarker} </s> Industrial Designer : So {disfmarker} </s> User Interface : {vocalsound} Looking at the user uh needs , we only uh don't {disfmarker} we don't have the double-curved case . We w we do have uh the rubber , we do have the colours . That's two out of three .

We did {gap} {disfmarker} yes , we did good . </s> Marketing : Okay , and uh was it innovative ? </s> User Interface : {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : Well , </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : with the voice recognition feature and uh {disfmarker} </s> User Interface : But that's not in it . Ov or can we {disfmarker} </s> Marketing : Yep . </s> Project Manager : No , we are evaluating this this uh design now . This prototype . </s> Industrial Designer : Well , let's let's {disfmarker} this product . </s> User Interface : Okay . </s> Industrial Designer : So I I I think it is . I think it's innovative . </s> Project Manager : Yeah . </s> User Interface : {vocalsound} And the scroll uh wheel . The solar {disfmarker} not many remotes have the solar , I think . </s> Industrial Designer : No . It could have been a little bit more innovative u by using the kinetic uh energy source , but it's it's way too {disfmarker} </s> Marketing : Yeah , and uh {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : That would have been a thrill . </s> Industrial Designer : yes , but {disfmarker} </s> Marketing : So uh also a uh two ? </s> Industrial Designer : I think uh it's a two . </s> Project Manager : Yep . </s> Marketing : Is it easy to use ? </s> Project Manager : I'm not sure . {vocalsound} I'm not sure . </s> User Interface : Yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} </s> User Interface : Well yeah , the voice recognition of course is hard to learn , I think . Well , hard {disfmarker} it's not for the for the e for the elderly . They won't use it . </s> Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Well , but there are two parts in this remote control . What you see here is is the basic part . Everybody can use it , so that's easy to use . </s> Project Manager : Yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : That's for a novice user . When you have a more advanced , elaborate user , well , such a user really would like to explore all these additional functions . So in that in that way it is advanced , </s> Project Manager : Yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : and I think it's easy to use for for both uh types of users . </s> User Interface : I think {disfmarker} I think a three . </s> Industrial Designer : So uh {disfmarker} It's maybe {disfmarker} it's not very uh easy for {disfmarker} </s> User Interface : {vocalsound} Wouldn't give it more . </s> Project Manager : Uh I'm doubting {disfmarker} doubting as well . Um {disfmarker} </s> Marketing : Well the p the most important function is easy to use . The the zapping , channel switching , volume . But the more advanced functions are probably a bit harder . </s> Project Manager : Okay . Uh two or three ? Three ? Wha wh what would be your guess ? I mean ease of use um does not only apply to the most basic functions . </s> Industrial Designer : Okay . </s> Project Manager : It's the uh it's it's overall . Is the device easy to use ? </s> Industrial Designer : Yeah , that's right . You're right in that , but I {gap} {disfmarker} I guess uh an advanced user will will find the voice recognition function easy to use , </s> Project Manager : Yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : because he is already {disfmarker} he or she is already an advanced user . </s> Project Manager : Yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : So {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : Um {disfmarker} Okay . </s> Industrial Designer : After all , I think {disfmarker} personally I would give a two . But {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : Uh Roo , a three ? </s> User Interface : Yep . </s> Project Manager : Ruud ? </s> Marketing : Good question . Uh I'll go uh for the two . </s> Project Manager : Okay . {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} </s> User Interface : {vocalsound} </s> Industrial Designer : So , it's two , two and three . Two threes . So that's ten . </s> Project Manager : So I could make it e easy ? </s> User Interface : If you make it a four it will be three in general . </s> Industrial Designer : So that's w No , two and a half . </s> User Interface : If he makes it a four . Not a three . </s> Industrial Designer : Six and four . Six and four is ten . Divided by four is two and a half . So {disfmarker} </s> User Interface : Darn . Nee . </s> Industrial Designer : Yes . {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : Hmm ? Huh ? </s> Project Manager : Roo . {vocalsound} </s> User Interface : A seven , a three {disfmarker} {vocalsound} No . </s> Marketing : Yeah . I yeah {gap} . </s> User Interface : A four and a three together . </s> Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Four ? </s> User Interface : Yeah , you have a two , he has a two . Three ? </s> Marketing : Yeah , </s> Industrial Designer : Two ? </s> Marketing : two , two , three {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : No , </s> User Interface : And a three ? </s> Project Manager : I haven't said anything yet . </s> User Interface : Nee . I know . </s> Marketing : No . {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : Okay , but if I would say a three , then it's six , and four is ten . Divided by four is two point five . </s> Industrial Designer : Divided by four . </s> User Interface : Yes . So if you want to have the conclusion as a three {disfmarker} three . Then you would make a four . If you fill out a four {disfmarker} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : But I'm filling in a three . </s> Industrial Designer : That's not even {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : Does it {disfmarker} will {disfmarker} so it will be a two point five . </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} </s> Industrial Designer : But that's not possible to fill in , </s> Project Manager : Yes , it is . </s> Industrial Designer : so we have to round it . {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} Is it easy to find ? {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : {vocalsound} I have a veto . {vocalsound} Exactly . It's not about the content , it's about {disfmarker} okay , um is it easy to f Yeah , definitely . </s> User Interface : Yeah , </s> Industrial Designer : Yes . </s> User Interface : we haven't re uh re uh really worked it out , but you c you can you can just say find and he repeats find . </s> Industrial Designer : It it most definitely is {disfmarker} it's very easy . </s> Project Manager : Yeah , or beeps or {disfmarker} yeah . </s> User Interface : Yeah , but that's the that's the the basic idea of the the speaker uh {disfmarker} </s> Industrial Designer : Yes . Maybe {disfmarker} Uh I I think I think {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : I'm here , I'm here . {vocalsound} </s> Industrial Designer : something like that . Maybe you have to uh programme it once , so to that l respond to uh a certain word or a certain sentence , something like where are you , and then it will sing I'm here . So something like that . </s> Project Manager : Yeah . Yeah . </s> User Interface : But even without it {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : Yeah . </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : Well , I uh {disfmarker} </s> Industrial Designer : So , I th </s> Project Manager : we should not uh stay too long on this subject uh because of the time , but I personally give it a one . </s> User Interface : Yeah . </s> Project Manager : Um Sebastian ? </s> Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Yeah , me too . </s> User Interface : Me too . </s> Marketing : Yeah , I agree . </s> Project Manager : Right , well . The feel of the remote control is spongy . Well , uh </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : it can't be more spongy . So {disfmarker} {vocalsound} </s> Industrial Designer : Well , it can be . There are cases um in which the outside casing is {disfmarker} um can be {disfmarker} uh how d how do you prono is is moldable . </s> User Interface : Was it one of our options ? </s> Industrial Designer : No , it's not one of our option , </s> Marketing : No . Uh </s> Project Manager : No okay , but but </s> User Interface : So , in the in {disfmarker} </s> Industrial Designer : but when you look in the market , when you look {disfmarker} </s> Marketing : this this was a most spongy option . {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : for the options given , it's the most spongy one . </s> Industrial Designer : Uh yes , </s> User Interface : Yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : but that's not that's not uh what they are talking about , I think . Because we compare all these uh characteristics {disfmarker} characteristics with uh market {disfmarker} uh with with the real market . </s> Project Manager : Yeah . Yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : So there are uh remote controls out there which are a lot more spongy . They're out there . {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : {vocalsound} They're out there . {vocalsound} </s> User Interface : {vocalsound} But I think in this case in this case we've done the best we could . </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : Yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : Yes , but it's not good enough , </s> Project Manager : {vocalsound} I'll give it a one . </s> Industrial Designer : so it's a two . </s> User Interface : {vocalsound} {vocalsound} I wan I'll take one . </s> Industrial Designer : You take one ? What do you give it ? </s> Marketing : Well yeah , it depends , 'cause it's the most spongy we could {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : Yeah , I know , but you have to name a fig uh a number . {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : but {disfmarker} yeah . </s> Project Manager : Because we need to go on {disfmarker} in {disfmarker} for the time . </s> Marketing : Well , if I give it a one there'll be one hell of a calculation . </s> User Interface : It will be a one . {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : So I'll just give it a two and make this a one point five . </s> Industrial Designer : No no no . Uh I'll I'll change it , I'll make it m my my mark will be a four . {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : {vocalsound} You are {disfmarker} </s> User Interface : {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : okay . </s> User Interface : {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : The remote control offers enough features . </s> User Interface : {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : Well , Ruud , what what do you think about it ? </s> Marketing : Well , the basic layout doesn't offem {disfmarker} offer much , but the voice recognition could add a lot . So {disfmarker} </s> Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Basically it's it's completely programmable . </s> Marketing : Yeah , depends . </s> Project Manager : Yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : You can add very m much functionality by uh using the voice recognition mode . </s> Project Manager : Yeah , I know . </s> Industrial Designer : So it's quite advanced . </s> Project Manager : What what we didn't talk about is um uh {disfmarker} </s> User Interface : Yeah , but {vocalsound} it ha doesn't has the digits . I believe it's {disfmarker} If you uh ask yourself it offers enough features , I don't I don't think it is {disfmarker} it has all the features um a normal remote has . </s> Project Manager : I think it has . </s> Marketing : Uh depends on what you uh implement in the speech feat </s> Project Manager : Yeah . Bec because you can um {disfmarker} we didn't talk about it , but you do have uh remote controls that are able to adapt another signal . So , </s> Industrial Designer : Yes . </s> Project Manager : you place a a regular uh remote control in front of the other one , hit the one or the two or the three , whatever , and it r records the uh the um {gap} {disfmarker} the the signals . </s> Industrial Designer : Has uh the signals sent to it . </s> User Interface : Yeah . </s> Marketing : Signal . </s> Project Manager : So you could uh uh uh enter any comment you like , as long it's able to {disfmarker} as long as our device is able to reproduce the infrared signal . So I think th this uh this is uh a a remote control with a very high level of features . </s> Industrial Designer : Absolutely . </s> Project Manager : Although there are i a few buttons , but the inside is is quite uh advanced . </s> Industrial Designer : Yes . But that {disfmarker} that's its power , I guess , because uh a regular programmable uh remote control contains , well , uh really a lot of buttons . At at least uh forty buttons . </s> Project Manager : Yeah . Yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : So it's it's quite s complicated to get uh to get used to . And this is quite s simple . </s> Project Manager : Yep . </s> Industrial Designer : You can use your voice to to programme it . It's {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : Yeah . Okay , um let's give it a number . I'll give it uh a one . For for the {disfmarker} for this t uh type of market , I think it's a one . </s> User Interface : I'll give a two . </s> Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Yeah , I'll give it a one . </s> Marketing : Um I think think a one , 'cause {gap} v with a voice recognition you could add anything you want , so that's like um {disfmarker} </s> Industrial Designer : Yes .

I think it's innovative . </s> Project Manager : Yeah . </s> User Interface : {vocalsound} And the scroll uh wheel . The solar {disfmarker} not many remotes have the solar , I think . </s> Industrial Designer : No . It could have been a little bit more innovative u by using the kinetic uh energy source , but it's it's way too {disfmarker} </s> Marketing : Yeah , and uh {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : That would have been a thrill . </s> Industrial Designer : yes , but {disfmarker} </s> Marketing : So uh also a uh two ? </s> Industrial Designer : I think uh it's a two . </s> Project Manager : Yep . </s> Marketing : Is it easy to use ? </s> Project Manager : I'm not sure . {vocalsound} I'm not sure . </s> User Interface : Yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} </s> User Interface : Well yeah , the voice recognition of course is hard to learn , I think .

What you see here is is the basic part . Everybody can use it , so that's easy to use . </s> Project Manager : Yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : That's for a novice user . When you have a more advanced , elaborate user , well , such a user really would like to explore all these additional functions .

Um {disfmarker} </s> Marketing : Well the p the most important function is easy to use . The the zapping , channel switching , volume . But the more advanced functions are probably a bit harder . </s> Project Manager : Okay . Uh two or three ? Three ? Wha wh what would be your guess ? I mean ease of use um does not only apply to the most basic functions . </s> Industrial Designer : Okay . </s> Project Manager : It's the uh it's it's overall . Is the device easy to use ? </s> Industrial Designer : Yeah , that's right . You're right in that , but I {gap} {disfmarker} I guess uh an advanced user will will find the voice recognition function easy to use , </s> Project Manager : Yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : because he is already {disfmarker} he or she is already an advanced user . </s> Project Manager : Yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : So {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : Um {disfmarker} Okay . </s> Industrial Designer : After all , I think {disfmarker} personally I would give a two .

Is it fancy ? </s> Project Manager : Yeah , I think so . </s> User Interface : Um the yellow rubber , I think so . </s> Industrial Designer : I think so . </s> Project Manager : {vocalsound} You like the rubber , uh Roo . {vocalsound} </s> User Interface : {vocalsound} I'm into it . {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} </s> Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : So uh one ? </s> Project Manager : Yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : But it's not that fancy . </s> Project Manager : No , I'll I'll I'll give it a two . </s> Industrial Designer : I mean I think uh {disfmarker} I think it would have been more fancy if we used the titanium housing {disfmarker} the casing .

Um {disfmarker} </s> User Interface : {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : Yeah , I know , </s> Marketing : Is it uh {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : but but it {disfmarker} but that's fancy in the way um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I mean fancy has has a lot of {disfmarker} </s> Industrial Designer : It has to do with fashion , I guess . </s> Project Manager : Yeah . </s> User Interface : It's trendy trendy , fun {disfmarker} {vocalsound} </s> Industrial Designer : So do {disfmarker} </s> Marketing : And w </s> User Interface : yeah . </s> Marketing : yeah , w what they want {disfmarker} wanted was uh colours and soft materials . </s> Project Manager : Yeah . </s> Marketing : So in that way {disfmarker} It {disfmarker} it's fancy . </s> Project Manager : It applies . It {disfmarker} yeah . </s> User Interface : Well , just {vocalsound} give it a two . </s> Industrial Designer : Okay . </s> Project Manager : Yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : Yes . </s> User Interface : It's not the ultimate uh fancy two , but {disfmarker} </s> Industrial Designer : I think I th I think it would have been {disfmarker} I would have think {disfmarker} uh it could have been more fancy by using the double-curved case . It would have been even more fancy , but we decided not to , because if we use a double-curved case , we could not use solar . </s> User Interface : Yeah , but that's sti that's uh {disfmarker} </s> Industrial Designer : So {disfmarker} </s> User Interface : {vocalsound} Looking at the user uh needs , we only uh don't {disfmarker} we don't have the double-curved case . We w we do have uh the rubber , we do have the colours . That's two out of three . So I believe uh we are close uh to two . </s> Industrial Designer : Yes . </s> Project Manager : Yeah , I I agree . </s> Industrial Designer : Yes , I agree too . It's okay . We did {gap} {disfmarker} yes , we did good . </s> Marketing : Okay , and uh was it innovative ? </s> User Interface : {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : Well , </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : with the voice recognition feature and uh {disfmarker} </s> User Interface : But that's not in it . Ov or can we {disfmarker} </s> Marketing : Yep . </s> Project Manager : No , we are evaluating this this uh design now . This prototype . </s> Industrial Designer : Well , let's let's {disfmarker} this product . </s> User Interface : Okay . </s> Industrial Designer : So I I I think it is . I think it's innovative . </s> Project Manager : Yeah . </s> User Interface : {vocalsound} And the scroll uh wheel . The solar {disfmarker} not many remotes have the solar , I think . </s> Industrial Designer : No . It could have been a little bit more innovative u by using the kinetic uh energy source , but it's it's way too {disfmarker} </s> Marketing : Yeah , and uh {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : That would have been a thrill . </s> Industrial Designer : yes , but {disfmarker} </s> Marketing : So uh also a uh two ? </s> Industrial Designer : I think uh it's a two . </s> Project Manager : Yep . </s> Marketing : Is it easy to use ? </s> Project Manager : I'm not sure . {vocalsound} I'm not sure . </s> User Interface : Yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} </s> User Interface : Well yeah , the voice recognition of course is hard to learn , I think . Well , hard {disfmarker} it's not for the for the e for the elderly . They won't use it . </s> Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Well , but there are two parts in this remote control . What you see here is is the basic part . Everybody can use it , so that's easy to use . </s> Project Manager : Yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : That's for a novice user . When you have a more advanced , elaborate user , well , such a user really would like to explore all these additional functions . So in that in that way it is advanced , </s> Project Manager : Yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : and I think it's easy to use for for both uh types of users . </s> User Interface : I think {disfmarker} I think a three . </s> Industrial Designer : So uh {disfmarker} It's maybe {disfmarker} it's not very uh easy for {disfmarker} </s> User Interface : {vocalsound} Wouldn't give it more . </s> Project Manager : Uh I'm doubting {disfmarker} doubting as well . Um {disfmarker} </s> Marketing : Well the p the most important function is easy to use . The the zapping , channel switching , volume . But the more advanced functions are probably a bit harder . </s> Project Manager : Okay . Uh two or three ? Three ? Wha wh what would be your guess ? I mean ease of use um does not only apply to the most basic functions . </s> Industrial Designer : Okay . </s> Project Manager : It's the uh it's it's overall . Is the device easy to use ? </s> Industrial Designer : Yeah , that's right . You're right in that , but I {gap} {disfmarker} I guess uh an advanced user will will find the voice recognition function easy to use , </s> Project Manager : Yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : because he is already {disfmarker} he or she is already an advanced user . </s> Project Manager : Yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : So {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : Um {disfmarker} Okay . </s> Industrial Designer : After all , I think {disfmarker} personally I would give a two . But {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : Uh Roo , a three ? </s> User Interface : Yep . </s> Project Manager : Ruud ? </s> Marketing : Good question . Uh I'll go uh for the two . </s> Project Manager : Okay . {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} </s> User Interface : {vocalsound} </s> Industrial Designer : So , it's two , two and three . Two threes . So that's ten . </s> Project Manager : So I could make it e easy ? </s> User Interface : If you make it a four it will be three in general . </s> Industrial Designer : So that's w No , two and a half . </s> User Interface : If he makes it a four . Not a three . </s> Industrial Designer : Six and four . Six and four is ten . Divided by four is two and a half . So {disfmarker} </s> User Interface : Darn . Nee . </s> Industrial Designer : Yes . {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : Hmm ? Huh ? </s> Project Manager : Roo . {vocalsound} </s> User Interface : A seven , a three {disfmarker} {vocalsound} No . </s> Marketing : Yeah . I yeah {gap} . </s> User Interface : A four and a three together . </s> Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Four ? </s> User Interface : Yeah , you have a two , he has a two . Three ? </s> Marketing : Yeah , </s> Industrial Designer : Two ? </s> Marketing : two , two , three {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : No , </s> User Interface : And a three ? </s> Project Manager : I haven't said anything yet . </s> User Interface : Nee . I know . </s> Marketing : No . {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : Okay , but if I would say a three , then it's six , and four is ten . Divided by four is two point five . </s> Industrial Designer : Divided by four . </s> User Interface : Yes . So if you want to have the conclusion as a three {disfmarker} three . Then you would make a four . If you fill out a four {disfmarker} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : But I'm filling in a three . </s> Industrial Designer : That's not even {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : Does it {disfmarker} will {disfmarker} so it will be a two point five . </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} </s> Industrial Designer : But that's not possible to fill in , </s> Project Manager : Yes , it is . </s> Industrial Designer : so we have to round it . {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} Is it easy to find ? {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : {vocalsound} I have a veto . {vocalsound} Exactly . It's not about the content , it's about {disfmarker} okay , um is it easy to f Yeah , definitely . </s> User Interface : Yeah , </s> Industrial Designer : Yes . </s> User Interface : we haven't re uh re uh really worked it out , but you c you can you can just say find and he repeats find . </s> Industrial Designer : It it most definitely is {disfmarker} it's very easy . </s> Project Manager : Yeah , or beeps or {disfmarker} yeah . </s> User Interface : Yeah , but that's the that's the the basic idea of the the speaker uh {disfmarker} </s> Industrial Designer : Yes . Maybe {disfmarker} Uh I I think I think {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : I'm here , I'm here . {vocalsound} </s> Industrial Designer : something like that . Maybe you have to uh programme it once , so to that l respond to uh a certain word or a certain sentence , something like where are you , and then it will sing I'm here . So something like that . </s> Project Manager : Yeah . Yeah . </s> User Interface : But even without it {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : Yeah . </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : Well , I uh {disfmarker} </s> Industrial Designer : So , I th </s> Project Manager : we should not uh stay too long on this subject uh because of the time , but I personally give it a one . </s> User Interface : Yeah . </s> Project Manager : Um Sebastian ? </s> Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Yeah , me too . </s> User Interface : Me too . </s> Marketing : Yeah , I agree . </s> Project Manager : Right , well . The feel of the remote control is spongy . Well , uh </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : it can't be more spongy . So {disfmarker} {vocalsound} </s> Industrial Designer : Well , it can be . There are cases um in which the outside casing is {disfmarker} um can be {disfmarker} uh how d how do you prono is is moldable . </s> User Interface : Was it one of our options ? </s> Industrial Designer : No , it's not one of our option , </s> Marketing : No . Uh </s> Project Manager : No okay , but but </s> User Interface : So , in the in {disfmarker} </s> Industrial Designer : but when you look in the market , when you look {disfmarker} </s> Marketing : this this was a most spongy option . {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : for the options given , it's the most spongy one . </s> Industrial Designer : Uh yes , </s> User Interface : Yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : but that's not that's not uh what they are talking about , I think . Because we compare all these uh characteristics {disfmarker} characteristics with uh market {disfmarker} uh with with the real market . </s> Project Manager : Yeah . Yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : So there are uh remote controls out there which are a lot more spongy . They're out there . {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : {vocalsound} They're out there . {vocalsound} </s> User Interface : {vocalsound} But I think in this case in this case we've done the best we could . </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : Yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : Yes , but it's not good enough , </s> Project Manager : {vocalsound} I'll give it a one . </s> Industrial Designer : so it's a two . </s> User Interface : {vocalsound} {vocalsound} I wan I'll take one . </s> Industrial Designer : You take one ? What do you give it ? </s> Marketing : Well yeah , it depends , 'cause it's the most spongy we could {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : Yeah , I know , but you have to name a fig uh a number . {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : but {disfmarker} yeah . </s> Project Manager : Because we need to go on {disfmarker} in {disfmarker} for the time . </s> Marketing : Well , if I give it a one there'll be one hell of a calculation . </s> User Interface : It will be a one . {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : So I'll just give it a two and make this a one point five . </s> Industrial Designer : No no no . Uh I'll I'll change it , I'll make it m my my mark will be a four . {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : {vocalsound} You are {disfmarker} </s> User Interface : {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : okay . </s> User Interface : {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : The remote control offers enough features . </s> User Interface : {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : Well , Ruud , what what do you think about it ? </s> Marketing : Well , the basic layout doesn't offem {disfmarker} offer much , but the voice recognition could add a lot . So {disfmarker} </s> Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Basically it's it's completely programmable . </s> Marketing : Yeah , depends . </s> Project Manager : Yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : You can add very m much functionality by uh using the voice recognition mode . </s> Project Manager : Yeah , I know . </s> Industrial Designer : So it's quite advanced . </s> Project Manager : What what we didn't talk about is um uh {disfmarker} </s> User Interface : Yeah , but {vocalsound} it ha doesn't has the digits . I believe it's {disfmarker} If you uh ask yourself it offers enough features , I don't I don't think it is {disfmarker} it has all the features um a normal remote has . </s> Project Manager : I think it has . </s> Marketing : Uh depends on what you uh implement in the speech feat </s> Project Manager : Yeah . Bec because you can um {disfmarker} we didn't talk about it , but you do have uh remote controls that are able to adapt another signal . So , </s> Industrial Designer : Yes . </s> Project Manager : you place a a regular uh remote control in front of the other one , hit the one or the two or the three , whatever , and it r records the uh the um {gap} {disfmarker} the the signals . </s> Industrial Designer : Has uh the signals sent to it . </s> User Interface : Yeah . </s> Marketing : Signal . </s> Project Manager : So you could uh uh uh enter any comment you like , as long it's able to {disfmarker} as long as our device is able to reproduce the infrared signal . So I think th this uh this is uh a a remote control with a very high level of features . </s> Industrial Designer : Absolutely . </s> Project Manager : Although there are i a few buttons , but the inside is is quite uh advanced . </s> Industrial Designer : Yes . But that {disfmarker} that's its power , I guess , because uh a regular programmable uh remote control contains , well , uh really a lot of buttons . At at least uh forty buttons . </s> Project Manager : Yeah . Yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : So it's it's quite s complicated to get uh to get used to . And this is quite s simple . </s> Project Manager : Yep . </s> Industrial Designer : You can use your voice to to programme it . It's {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : Yeah . Okay , um let's give it a number . I'll give it uh a one . For for the {disfmarker} for this t uh type of market , I think it's a one . </s> User Interface : I'll give a two . </s> Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Yeah , I'll give it a one . </s> Marketing : Um I think think a one , 'cause {gap} v with a voice recognition you could add anything you want , so that's like um {disfmarker} </s> Industrial Designer : Yes . I I've {disfmarker} I think we've uh succe succeed in in developing a product that's actually quite good , but not for this kind of market , and not for this kind of price . </s> User Interface : {vocalsound} {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : Yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : So {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : So high quality , low acceptance . </s> Industrial Designer : Hmm .",

So {disfmarker} </s> Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Basically it's it's completely programmable . </s> Marketing : Yeah , depends . </s> Project Manager : Yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : You can add very m much functionality by uh using the voice recognition mode . </s> Project Manager : Yeah , I know . </s> Industrial Designer : So it's quite advanced . </s> Project Manager : What what we didn't talk about is um uh {disfmarker} </s> User Interface : Yeah , but {vocalsound} it ha doesn't has the digits .

Bec because you can um {disfmarker} we didn't talk about it , but you do have uh remote controls that are able to adapt another signal .

We did {gap} {disfmarker} yes , we did good . </s> Marketing : Okay , and uh was it innovative ? </s> User Interface : {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : Well , </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : with the voice recognition feature and uh {disfmarker} </s> User Interface : But that's not in it .

This prototype . </s> Industrial Designer : Well , let's let's {disfmarker} this product . </s> User Interface : Okay . </s> Industrial Designer : So I I I think it is . I think it's innovative . </s> Project Manager : Yeah . </s> User Interface : {vocalsound} And the scroll uh wheel . The solar {disfmarker} not many remotes have the solar , I think . </s> Industrial Designer : No . It could have been a little bit more innovative u by using the kinetic uh energy source , but it's it's way too {disfmarker} </s> Marketing : Yeah , and uh {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : That would have been a thrill . </s> Industrial Designer : yes , but {disfmarker} </s> Marketing : So uh also a uh two ? </s> Industrial Designer : I think uh it's a two . </s> Project Manager : Yep . </s> Marketing : Is it easy to use ? </s> Project Manager : I'm not sure . {vocalsound} I'm not sure . </s> User Interface : Yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} </s> User Interface : Well yeah , the voice recognition of course is hard to learn , I think . Well , hard {disfmarker} it's not for the for the e for the elderly . They won't use it . </s> Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Well , but there are two parts in this remote control . What you see here is is the basic part . Everybody can use it , so that's easy to use . </s> Project Manager : Yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : That's for a novice user . When you have a more advanced , elaborate user , well , such a user really would like to explore all these additional functions . So in that in that way it is advanced , </s> Project Manager : Yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : and I think it's easy to use for for both uh types of users . </s> User Interface : I think {disfmarker} I think a three . </s> Industrial Designer : So uh {disfmarker} It's maybe {disfmarker} it's not very uh easy for {disfmarker} </s> User Interface : {vocalsound} Wouldn't give it more . </s> Project Manager : Uh I'm doubting {disfmarker} doubting as well . Um {disfmarker} </s> Marketing : Well the p the most important function is easy to use . The the zapping , channel switching , volume . But the more advanced functions are probably a bit harder . </s> Project Manager : Okay . Uh two or three ? Three ? Wha wh what would be your guess ? I mean ease of use um does not only apply to the most basic functions . </s> Industrial Designer : Okay . </s> Project Manager : It's the uh it's it's overall . Is the device easy to use ? </s> Industrial Designer : Yeah , that's right . You're right in that , but I {gap} {disfmarker} I guess uh an advanced user will will find the voice recognition function easy to use , </s> Project Manager : Yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : because he is already {disfmarker} he or she is already an advanced user . </s> Project Manager : Yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : So {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : Um {disfmarker} Okay . </s> Industrial Designer : After all , I think {disfmarker} personally I would give a two . But {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : Uh Roo , a three ? </s> User Interface : Yep . </s> Project Manager : Ruud ? </s> Marketing : Good question . Uh I'll go uh for the two . </s> Project Manager : Okay . {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} </s> User Interface : {vocalsound} </s> Industrial Designer : So , it's two , two and three . Two threes . So that's ten . </s> Project Manager : So I could make it e easy ? </s> User Interface : If you make it a four it will be three in general . </s> Industrial Designer : So that's w No , two and a half . </s> User Interface : If he makes it a four . Not a three . </s> Industrial Designer : Six and four . Six and four is ten . Divided by four is two and a half . So {disfmarker} </s> User Interface : Darn . Nee . </s> Industrial Designer : Yes . {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : Hmm ? Huh ? </s> Project Manager : Roo . {vocalsound} </s> User Interface : A seven , a three {disfmarker} {vocalsound} No . </s> Marketing : Yeah . I yeah {gap} . </s> User Interface : A four and a three together . </s> Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Four ? </s> User Interface : Yeah , you have a two , he has a two . Three ? </s> Marketing : Yeah , </s> Industrial Designer : Two ? </s> Marketing : two , two , three {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : No , </s> User Interface : And a three ? </s> Project Manager : I haven't said anything yet . </s> User Interface : Nee . I know . </s> Marketing : No . {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : Okay , but if I would say a three , then it's six , and four is ten . Divided by four is two point five . </s> Industrial Designer : Divided by four . </s> User Interface : Yes . So if you want to have the conclusion as a three {disfmarker} three . Then you would make a four . If you fill out a four {disfmarker} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : But I'm filling in a three . </s> Industrial Designer : That's not even {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : Does it {disfmarker} will {disfmarker} so it will be a two point five . </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} </s> Industrial Designer : But that's not possible to fill in , </s> Project Manager : Yes , it is . </s> Industrial Designer : so we have to round it . {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} Is it easy to find ? {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : {vocalsound} I have a veto . {vocalsound} Exactly . It's not about the content , it's about {disfmarker} okay , um is it easy to f Yeah , definitely . </s> User Interface : Yeah , </s> Industrial Designer : Yes . </s> User Interface : we haven't re uh re uh really worked it out , but you c you can you can just say find and he repeats find . </s> Industrial Designer : It it most definitely is {disfmarker} it's very easy . </s> Project Manager : Yeah , or beeps or {disfmarker} yeah . </s> User Interface : Yeah , but that's the that's the the basic idea of the the speaker uh {disfmarker} </s> Industrial Designer : Yes . Maybe {disfmarker} Uh I I think I think {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : I'm here , I'm here . {vocalsound} </s> Industrial Designer : something like that . Maybe you have to uh programme it once , so to that l respond to uh a certain word or a certain sentence , something like where are you , and then it will sing I'm here . So something like that . </s> Project Manager : Yeah . Yeah . </s> User Interface : But even without it {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : Yeah . </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : Well , I uh {disfmarker} </s> Industrial Designer : So , I th </s> Project Manager : we should not uh stay too long on this subject uh because of the time , but I personally give it a one . </s> User Interface : Yeah . </s> Project Manager : Um Sebastian ? </s> Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Yeah , me too . </s> User Interface : Me too . </s> Marketing : Yeah , I agree . </s> Project Manager : Right , well . The feel of the remote control is spongy . Well , uh </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : it can't be more spongy . So {disfmarker} {vocalsound} </s> Industrial Designer : Well , it can be . There are cases um in which the outside casing is {disfmarker} um can be {disfmarker} uh how d how do you prono is is moldable . </s> User Interface : Was it one of our options ? </s> Industrial Designer : No , it's not one of our option , </s> Marketing : No . Uh </s> Project Manager : No okay , but but </s> User Interface : So , in the in {disfmarker} </s> Industrial Designer : but when you look in the market , when you look {disfmarker} </s> Marketing : this this was a most spongy option . {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : for the options given , it's the most spongy one . </s> Industrial Designer : Uh yes , </s> User Interface : Yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : but that's not that's not uh what they are talking about , I think .

We did {gap} {disfmarker} yes , we did good . </s> Marketing : Okay , and uh was it innovative ? </s> User Interface : {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : Well , </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : with the voice recognition feature and uh {disfmarker} </s> User Interface : But that's not in it . Ov or can we {disfmarker} </s> Marketing : Yep . </s> Project Manager : No , we are evaluating this this uh design now . This prototype . </s> Industrial Designer : Well , let's let's {disfmarker} this product . </s> User Interface : Okay . </s> Industrial Designer : So I I I think it is . I think it's innovative . </s> Project Manager : Yeah . </s> User Interface : {vocalsound} And the scroll uh wheel . The solar {disfmarker} not many remotes have the solar , I think . </s> Industrial Designer : No . It could have been a little bit more innovative u by using the kinetic uh energy source , but it's it's way too {disfmarker} </s> Marketing : Yeah , and uh {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : That would have been a thrill . </s> Industrial Designer : yes , but {disfmarker} </s> Marketing : So uh also a uh two ? </s> Industrial Designer : I think uh it's a two . </s> Project Manager : Yep . </s> Marketing : Is it easy to use ? </s> Project Manager : I'm not sure . {vocalsound} I'm not sure . </s> User Interface : Yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} </s> User Interface : Well yeah , the voice recognition of course is hard to learn , I think . Well , hard {disfmarker} it's not for the for the e for the elderly . They won't use it . </s> Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Well , but there are two parts in this remote control . What you see here is is the basic part . Everybody can use it , so that's easy to use . </s> Project Manager : Yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : That's for a novice user . When you have a more advanced , elaborate user , well , such a user really would like to explore all these additional functions . So in that in that way it is advanced , </s> Project Manager : Yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : and I think it's easy to use for for both uh types of users . </s> User Interface : I think {disfmarker} I think a three . </s> Industrial Designer : So uh {disfmarker} It's maybe {disfmarker} it's not very uh easy for {disfmarker} </s> User Interface : {vocalsound} Wouldn't give it more . </s> Project Manager : Uh I'm doubting {disfmarker} doubting as well . Um {disfmarker} </s> Marketing : Well the p the most important function is easy to use . The the zapping , channel switching , volume . But the more advanced functions are probably a bit harder . </s> Project Manager : Okay . Uh two or three ? Three ? Wha wh what would be your guess ? I mean ease of use um does not only apply to the most basic functions . </s> Industrial Designer : Okay . </s> Project Manager : It's the uh it's it's overall . Is the device easy to use ? </s> Industrial Designer : Yeah , that's right . You're right in that , but I {gap} {disfmarker} I guess uh an advanced user will will find the voice recognition function easy to use , </s> Project Manager : Yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : because he is already {disfmarker} he or she is already an advanced user . </s> Project Manager : Yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : So {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : Um {disfmarker} Okay . </s> Industrial Designer : After all , I think {disfmarker} personally I would give a two . But {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : Uh Roo , a three ? </s> User Interface : Yep . </s> Project Manager : Ruud ? </s> Marketing : Good question . Uh I'll go uh for the two . </s> Project Manager : Okay . {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} </s> User Interface : {vocalsound} </s> Industrial Designer : So , it's two , two and three . Two threes . So that's ten . </s> Project Manager : So I could make it e easy ? </s> User Interface : If you make it a four it will be three in general . </s> Industrial Designer : So that's w No , two and a half . </s> User Interface : If he makes it a four . Not a three . </s> Industrial Designer : Six and four . Six and four is ten . Divided by four is two and a half . So {disfmarker} </s> User Interface : Darn . Nee . </s> Industrial Designer : Yes . {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : Hmm ? Huh ? </s> Project Manager : Roo . {vocalsound} </s> User Interface : A seven , a three {disfmarker} {vocalsound} No . </s> Marketing : Yeah . I yeah {gap} . </s> User Interface : A four and a three together . </s> Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Four ? </s> User Interface : Yeah , you have a two , he has a two . Three ? </s> Marketing : Yeah , </s> Industrial Designer : Two ? </s> Marketing : two , two , three {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : No , </s> User Interface : And a three ? </s> Project Manager : I haven't said anything yet . </s> User Interface : Nee . I know . </s> Marketing : No . {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : Okay , but if I would say a three , then it's six , and four is ten . Divided by four is two point five . </s> Industrial Designer : Divided by four . </s> User Interface : Yes . So if you want to have the conclusion as a three {disfmarker} three . Then you would make a four . If you fill out a four {disfmarker} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : But I'm filling in a three . </s> Industrial Designer : That's not even {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : Does it {disfmarker} will {disfmarker} so it will be a two point five . </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} </s> Industrial Designer : But that's not possible to fill in , </s> Project Manager : Yes , it is . </s> Industrial Designer : so we have to round it . {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} Is it easy to find ? {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : {vocalsound} I have a veto . {vocalsound} Exactly .

Maybe {disfmarker} Uh I I think I think {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : I'm here , I'm here . {vocalsound} </s> Industrial Designer : something like that . Maybe you have to uh programme it once , so to that l respond to uh a certain word or a certain sentence , something like where are you , and then it will sing I'm here . So something like that . </s> Project Manager : Yeah . Yeah . </s> User Interface : But even without it {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : Yeah . </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : Well , I uh {disfmarker} </s> Industrial Designer : So , I th </s> Project Manager : we should not uh stay too long on this subject uh because of the time , but I personally give it a one . </s> User Interface : Yeah . </s> Project Manager : Um Sebastian ? </s> Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Yeah , me too . </s> User Interface : Me too . </s> Marketing : Yeah , I agree . </s> Project Manager : Right , well . The feel of the remote control is spongy . Well , uh </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : it can't be more spongy . So {disfmarker} {vocalsound} </s> Industrial Designer : Well , it can be . There are cases um in which the outside casing is {disfmarker} um can be {disfmarker} uh how d how do you prono is is moldable . </s> User Interface : Was it one of our options ? </s> Industrial Designer : No , it's not one of our option , </s> Marketing : No . Uh </s> Project Manager : No okay , but but </s> User Interface : So , in the in {disfmarker} </s> Industrial Designer : but when you look in the market , when you look {disfmarker} </s> Marketing : this this was a most spongy option . {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : for the options given , it's the most spongy one . </s> Industrial Designer : Uh yes , </s> User Interface : Yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : but that's not that's not uh what they are talking about , I think . Because we compare all these uh characteristics {disfmarker} characteristics with uh market {disfmarker} uh with with the real market . </s> Project Manager : Yeah . Yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : So there are uh remote controls out there which are a lot more spongy . They're out there . {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : {vocalsound} They're out there . {vocalsound} </s> User Interface : {vocalsound} But I think in this case in this case we've done the best we could . </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : Yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : Yes , but it's not good enough , </s> Project Manager : {vocalsound} I'll give it a one . </s> Industrial Designer : so it's a two . </s> User Interface : {vocalsound} {vocalsound} I wan I'll take one . </s> Industrial Designer : You take one ? What do you give it ? </s> Marketing : Well yeah , it depends , 'cause it's the most spongy we could {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : Yeah , I know , but you have to name a fig uh a number . {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : but {disfmarker} yeah . </s> Project Manager : Because we need to go on {disfmarker} in {disfmarker} for the time . </s> Marketing : Well , if I give it a one there'll be one hell of a calculation . </s> User Interface : It will be a one . {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : So I'll just give it a two and make this a one point five . </s> Industrial Designer : No no no . Uh I'll I'll change it , I'll make it m my my mark will be a four . {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : {vocalsound} You are {disfmarker} </s> User Interface : {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : okay . </s> User Interface : {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : The remote control offers enough features . </s> User Interface : {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : Well , Ruud , what what do you think about it ? </s> Marketing : Well , the basic layout doesn't offem {disfmarker} offer much , but the voice recognition could add a lot . So {disfmarker} </s> Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Basically it's it's completely programmable . </s> Marketing : Yeah , depends . </s> Project Manager : Yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : You can add very m much functionality by uh using the voice recognition mode . </s> Project Manager : Yeah , I know . </s> Industrial Designer : So it's quite advanced . </s> Project Manager : What what we didn't talk about is um uh {disfmarker} </s> User Interface : Yeah , but {vocalsound} it ha doesn't has the digits . I believe it's {disfmarker} If you uh ask yourself it offers enough features , I don't I don't think it is {disfmarker} it has all the features um a normal remote has . </s> Project Manager : I think it has . </s> Marketing : Uh depends on what you uh implement in the speech feat </s> Project Manager : Yeah . Bec because you can um {disfmarker} we didn't talk about it , but you do have uh remote controls that are able to adapt another signal . So , </s> Industrial Designer : Yes . </s> Project Manager : you place a a regular uh remote control in front of the other one , hit the one or the two or the three , whatever , and it r records the uh the um {gap} {disfmarker} the the signals . </s> Industrial Designer : Has uh the signals sent to it . </s> User Interface : Yeah . </s> Marketing : Signal . </s> Project Manager : So you could uh uh uh enter any comment you like , as long it's able to {disfmarker} as long as our device is able to reproduce the infrared signal . So I think th this uh this is uh a a remote control with a very high level of features . </s> Industrial Designer : Absolutely . </s> Project Manager : Although there are i a few buttons , but the inside is is quite uh advanced . </s> Industrial Designer : Yes . But that {disfmarker} that's its power , I guess , because uh a regular programmable uh remote control contains , well , uh really a lot of buttons . At at least uh forty buttons . </s> Project Manager : Yeah . Yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : So it's it's quite s complicated to get uh to get used to . And this is quite s simple . </s> Project Manager : Yep . </s> Industrial Designer : You can use your voice to to programme it . It's {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : Yeah . Okay , um let's give it a number . I'll give it uh a one . For for the {disfmarker} for this t uh type of market , I think it's a one . </s> User Interface : I'll give a two . </s> Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Yeah , I'll give it a one . </s> Marketing : Um I think think a one , 'cause {gap} v with a voice recognition you could add anything you want , so that's like um {disfmarker} </s> Industrial Designer : Yes . I I've {disfmarker} I think we've uh succe succeed in in developing a product that's actually quite good , but not for this kind of market , and not for this kind of price . </s> User Interface : {vocalsound} {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : Yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : So {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : So high quality , low acceptance . </s> Industrial Designer : Hmm .",

I think it's innovative . </s> Project Manager : Yeah . </s> User Interface : {vocalsound} And the scroll uh wheel . The solar {disfmarker} not many remotes have the solar , I think . </s> Industrial Designer : No . It could have been a little bit more innovative u by using the kinetic uh energy source , but it's it's way too {disfmarker} </s> Marketing : Yeah , and uh {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : That would have been a thrill . </s> Industrial Designer : yes , but {disfmarker} </s> Marketing : So uh also a uh two ? </s> Industrial Designer : I think uh it's a two . </s> Project Manager : Yep . </s> Marketing : Is it easy to use ? </s> Project Manager : I'm not sure . {vocalsound} I'm not sure . </s> User Interface : Yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} </s> User Interface : Well yeah , the voice recognition of course is hard to learn , I think . Well , hard {disfmarker} it's not for the for the e for the elderly . They won't use it . </s> Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Well , but there are two parts in this remote control . What you see here is is the basic part . Everybody can use it , so that's easy to use . </s> Project Manager : Yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : That's for a novice user . When you have a more advanced , elaborate user , well , such a user really would like to explore all these additional functions . So in that in that way it is advanced , </s> Project Manager : Yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : and I think it's easy to use for for both uh types of users . </s> User Interface : I think {disfmarker} I think a three . </s> Industrial Designer : So uh {disfmarker} It's maybe {disfmarker} it's not very uh easy for {disfmarker} </s> User Interface : {vocalsound} Wouldn't give it more . </s> Project Manager : Uh I'm doubting {disfmarker} doubting as well . Um {disfmarker} </s> Marketing : Well the p the most important function is easy to use . The the zapping , channel switching , volume . But the more advanced functions are probably a bit harder . </s> Project Manager : Okay . Uh two or three ? Three ? Wha wh what would be your guess ? I mean ease of use um does not only apply to the most basic functions . </s> Industrial Designer : Okay . </s> Project Manager : It's the uh it's it's overall . Is the device easy to use ? </s> Industrial Designer : Yeah , that's right . You're right in that , but I {gap} {disfmarker} I guess uh an advanced user will will find the voice recognition function easy to use , </s> Project Manager : Yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : because he is already {disfmarker} he or she is already an advanced user . </s> Project Manager : Yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : So {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : Um {disfmarker} Okay . </s> Industrial Designer : After all , I think {disfmarker} personally I would give a two . But {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : Uh Roo , a three ? </s> User Interface : Yep . </s> Project Manager : Ruud ? </s> Marketing : Good question . Uh I'll go uh for the two . </s> Project Manager : Okay . {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} </s> User Interface : {vocalsound} </s> Industrial Designer : So , it's two , two and three . Two threes . So that's ten . </s> Project Manager : So I could make it e easy ? </s> User Interface : If you make it a four it will be three in general . </s> Industrial Designer : So that's w No , two and a half . </s> User Interface : If he makes it a four . Not a three . </s> Industrial Designer : Six and four . Six and four is ten . Divided by four is two and a half . So {disfmarker} </s> User Interface : Darn . Nee . </s> Industrial Designer : Yes . {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : Hmm ? Huh ? </s> Project Manager : Roo . {vocalsound} </s> User Interface : A seven , a three {disfmarker} {vocalsound} No . </s> Marketing : Yeah . I yeah {gap} . </s> User Interface : A four and a three together . </s> Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Four ? </s> User Interface : Yeah , you have a two , he has a two . Three ? </s> Marketing : Yeah , </s> Industrial Designer : Two ? </s> Marketing : two , two , three {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : No , </s> User Interface : And a three ? </s> Project Manager : I haven't said anything yet . </s> User Interface : Nee . I know . </s> Marketing : No . {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : Okay , but if I would say a three , then it's six , and four is ten . Divided by four is two point five . </s> Industrial Designer : Divided by four . </s> User Interface : Yes . So if you want to have the conclusion as a three {disfmarker} three . Then you would make a four . If you fill out a four {disfmarker} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : But I'm filling in a three . </s> Industrial Designer : That's not even {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : Does it {disfmarker} will {disfmarker} so it will be a two point five . </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} </s> Industrial Designer : But that's not possible to fill in , </s> Project Manager : Yes , it is . </s> Industrial Designer : so we have to round it . {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} Is it easy to find ? {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : {vocalsound} I have a veto . {vocalsound} Exactly . It's not about the content , it's about {disfmarker} okay , um is it easy to f Yeah , definitely . </s> User Interface : Yeah , </s> Industrial Designer : Yes . </s> User Interface : we haven't re uh re uh really worked it out , but you c you can you can just say find and he repeats find . </s> Industrial Designer : It it most definitely is {disfmarker} it's very easy . </s> Project Manager : Yeah , or beeps or {disfmarker} yeah . </s> User Interface : Yeah , but that's the that's the the basic idea of the the speaker uh {disfmarker} </s> Industrial Designer : Yes . Maybe {disfmarker} Uh I I think I think {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : I'm here , I'm here . {vocalsound} </s> Industrial Designer : something like that . Maybe you have to uh programme it once , so to that l respond to uh a certain word or a certain sentence , something like where are you , and then it will sing I'm here . So something like that . </s> Project Manager : Yeah . Yeah . </s> User Interface : But even without it {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : Yeah . </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : Well , I uh {disfmarker} </s> Industrial Designer : So , I th </s> Project Manager : we should not uh stay too long on this subject uh because of the time , but I personally give it a one . </s> User Interface : Yeah . </s> Project Manager : Um Sebastian ? </s> Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Yeah , me too . </s> User Interface : Me too . </s> Marketing : Yeah , I agree . </s> Project Manager : Right , well . The feel of the remote control is spongy . Well , uh </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : it can't be more spongy . So {disfmarker} {vocalsound} </s> Industrial Designer : Well , it can be . There are cases um in which the outside casing is {disfmarker} um can be {disfmarker} uh how d how do you prono is is moldable . </s> User Interface : Was it one of our options ? </s> Industrial Designer : No , it's not one of our option , </s> Marketing : No . Uh </s> Project Manager : No okay , but but </s> User Interface : So , in the in {disfmarker} </s> Industrial Designer : but when you look in the market , when you look {disfmarker} </s> Marketing : this this was a most spongy option . {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : for the options given , it's the most spongy one . </s> Industrial Designer : Uh yes , </s> User Interface : Yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : but that's not that's not uh what they are talking about , I think . Because we compare all these uh characteristics {disfmarker} characteristics with uh market {disfmarker} uh with with the real market . </s> Project Manager : Yeah . Yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : So there are uh remote controls out there which are a lot more spongy . They're out there . {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : {vocalsound} They're out there . {vocalsound} </s> User Interface : {vocalsound} But I think in this case in this case we've done the best we could . </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : Yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : Yes , but it's not good enough , </s> Project Manager : {vocalsound} I'll give it a one . </s> Industrial Designer : so it's a two . </s> User Interface : {vocalsound} {vocalsound} I wan I'll take one . </s> Industrial Designer : You take one ? What do you give it ? </s> Marketing : Well yeah , it depends , 'cause it's the most spongy we could {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : Yeah , I know , but you have to name a fig uh a number . {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : but {disfmarker} yeah . </s> Project Manager : Because we need to go on {disfmarker} in {disfmarker} for the time . </s> Marketing : Well , if I give it a one there'll be one hell of a calculation . </s> User Interface : It will be a one . {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : So I'll just give it a two and make this a one point five . </s> Industrial Designer : No no no . Uh I'll I'll change it , I'll make it m my my mark will be a four . {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : {vocalsound} You are {disfmarker} </s> User Interface : {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : okay . </s> User Interface : {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : The remote control offers enough features . </s> User Interface : {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : Well , Ruud , what what do you think about it ? </s> Marketing : Well , the basic layout doesn't offem {disfmarker} offer much , but the voice recognition could add a lot . So {disfmarker} </s> Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Basically it's it's completely programmable . </s> Marketing : Yeah , depends . </s> Project Manager : Yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : You can add very m much functionality by uh using the voice recognition mode . </s> Project Manager : Yeah , I know . </s> Industrial Designer : So it's quite advanced . </s> Project Manager : What what we didn't talk about is um uh {disfmarker} </s> User Interface : Yeah , but {vocalsound} it ha doesn't has the digits . I believe it's {disfmarker} If you uh ask yourself it offers enough features , I don't I don't think it is {disfmarker} it has all the features um a normal remote has . </s> Project Manager : I think it has . </s> Marketing : Uh depends on what you uh implement in the speech feat </s> Project Manager : Yeah .

Is the device easy to use ? </s> Industrial Designer : Yeah , that's right . You're right in that , but I {gap} {disfmarker} I guess uh an advanced user will will find the voice recognition function easy to use , </s> Project Manager : Yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : because he is already {disfmarker} he or she is already an advanced user . </s> Project Manager : Yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : So {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : Um {disfmarker} Okay . </s> Industrial Designer : After all , I think {disfmarker} personally I would give a two . But {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : Uh Roo , a three ? </s> User Interface : Yep . </s> Project Manager : Ruud ? </s> Marketing : Good question . Uh I'll go uh for the two . </s> Project Manager : Okay . {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} </s> User Interface : {vocalsound} </s> Industrial Designer : So , it's two , two and three . Two threes . So that's ten . </s> Project Manager : So I could make it e easy ? </s> User Interface : If you make it a four it will be three in general . </s> Industrial Designer : So that's w No , two and a half . </s> User Interface : If he makes it a four . Not a three . </s> Industrial Designer : Six and four . Six and four is ten . Divided by four is two and a half . So {disfmarker} </s> User Interface : Darn . Nee . </s> Industrial Designer : Yes . {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : Hmm ? Huh ? </s> Project Manager : Roo . {vocalsound} </s> User Interface : A seven , a three {disfmarker} {vocalsound} No . </s> Marketing : Yeah . I yeah {gap} . </s> User Interface : A four and a three together . </s> Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Four ? </s> User Interface : Yeah , you have a two , he has a two . Three ? </s> Marketing : Yeah , </s> Industrial Designer : Two ? </s> Marketing : two , two , three {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : No , </s> User Interface : And a three ? </s> Project Manager : I haven't said anything yet . </s> User Interface : Nee . I know . </s> Marketing : No . {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : Okay , but if I would say a three , then it's six , and four is ten . Divided by four is two point five . </s> Industrial Designer : Divided by four . </s> User Interface : Yes . So if you want to have the conclusion as a three {disfmarker} three . Then you would make a four . If you fill out a four {disfmarker} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : But I'm filling in a three . </s> Industrial Designer : That's not even {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : Does it {disfmarker} will {disfmarker} so it will be a two point five . </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} </s> Industrial Designer : But that's not possible to fill in , </s> Project Manager : Yes , it is . </s> Industrial Designer : so we have to round it . {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} Is it easy to find ? {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : {vocalsound} I have a veto . {vocalsound} Exactly . It's not about the content , it's about {disfmarker} okay , um is it easy to f Yeah , definitely . </s> User Interface : Yeah , </s> Industrial Designer : Yes . </s> User Interface : we haven't re uh re uh really worked it out , but you c you can you can just say find and he repeats find . </s> Industrial Designer : It it most definitely is {disfmarker} it's very easy . </s> Project Manager : Yeah , or beeps or {disfmarker} yeah . </s> User Interface : Yeah , but that's the that's the the basic idea of the the speaker uh {disfmarker} </s> Industrial Designer : Yes . Maybe {disfmarker} Uh I I think I think {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : I'm here , I'm here . {vocalsound} </s> Industrial Designer : something like that . Maybe you have to uh programme it once , so to that l respond to uh a certain word or a certain sentence , something like where are you , and then it will sing I'm here . So something like that . </s> Project Manager : Yeah . Yeah . </s> User Interface : But even without it {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : Yeah . </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : Well , I uh {disfmarker} </s> Industrial Designer : So , I th </s> Project Manager : we should not uh stay too long on this subject uh because of the time , but I personally give it a one . </s> User Interface : Yeah . </s> Project Manager : Um Sebastian ? </s> Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Yeah , me too . </s> User Interface : Me too . </s> Marketing : Yeah , I agree . </s> Project Manager : Right , well . The feel of the remote control is spongy . Well , uh </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : it can't be more spongy . So {disfmarker} {vocalsound} </s> Industrial Designer : Well , it can be . There are cases um in which the outside casing is {disfmarker} um can be {disfmarker} uh how d how do you prono is is moldable . </s> User Interface : Was it one of our options ? </s> Industrial Designer : No , it's not one of our option , </s> Marketing : No . Uh </s> Project Manager : No okay , but but </s> User Interface : So , in the in {disfmarker} </s> Industrial Designer : but when you look in the market , when you look {disfmarker} </s> Marketing : this this was a most spongy option . {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : for the options given , it's the most spongy one . </s> Industrial Designer : Uh yes , </s> User Interface : Yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : but that's not that's not uh what they are talking about , I think . Because we compare all these uh characteristics {disfmarker} characteristics with uh market {disfmarker} uh with with the real market . </s> Project Manager : Yeah . Yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : So there are uh remote controls out there which are a lot more spongy . They're out there . {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : {vocalsound} They're out there . {vocalsound} </s> User Interface : {vocalsound} But I think in this case in this case we've done the best we could . </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : Yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : Yes , but it's not good enough , </s> Project Manager : {vocalsound} I'll give it a one . </s> Industrial Designer : so it's a two . </s> User Interface : {vocalsound} {vocalsound} I wan I'll take one . </s> Industrial Designer : You take one ? What do you give it ? </s> Marketing : Well yeah , it depends , 'cause it's the most spongy we could {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : Yeah , I know , but you have to name a fig uh a number . {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : but {disfmarker} yeah . </s> Project Manager : Because we need to go on {disfmarker} in {disfmarker} for the time . </s> Marketing : Well , if I give it a one there'll be one hell of a calculation . </s> User Interface : It will be a one . {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : So I'll just give it a two and make this a one point five . </s> Industrial Designer : No no no . Uh I'll I'll change it , I'll make it m my my mark will be a four . {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : {vocalsound} You are {disfmarker} </s> User Interface : {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : okay . </s> User Interface : {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : The remote control offers enough features . </s> User Interface : {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : Well , Ruud , what what do you think about it ? </s> Marketing : Well , the basic layout doesn't offem {disfmarker} offer much , but the voice recognition could add a lot . So {disfmarker} </s> Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Basically it's it's completely programmable . </s> Marketing : Yeah , depends . </s> Project Manager : Yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : You can add very m much functionality by uh using the voice recognition mode . </s> Project Manager : Yeah , I know . </s> Industrial Designer : So it's quite advanced . </s> Project Manager : What what we didn't talk about is um uh {disfmarker} </s> User Interface : Yeah , but {vocalsound} it ha doesn't has the digits . I believe it's {disfmarker} If you uh ask yourself it offers enough features , I don't I don't think it is {disfmarker} it has all the features um a normal remote has . </s> Project Manager : I think it has . </s> Marketing : Uh depends on what you uh implement in the speech feat </s> Project Manager : Yeah . Bec because you can um {disfmarker} we didn't talk about it , but you do have uh remote controls that are able to adapt another signal . So , </s> Industrial Designer : Yes . </s> Project Manager : you place a a regular uh remote control in front of the other one , hit the one or the two or the three , whatever , and it r records the uh the um {gap} {disfmarker} the the signals . </s> Industrial Designer : Has uh the signals sent to it . </s> User Interface : Yeah . </s> Marketing : Signal . </s> Project Manager : So you could uh uh uh enter any comment you like , as long it's able to {disfmarker} as long as our device is able to reproduce the infrared signal . So I think th this uh this is uh a a remote control with a very high level of features . </s> Industrial Designer : Absolutely . </s> Project Manager : Although there are i a few buttons , but the inside is is quite uh advanced . </s> Industrial Designer : Yes . But that {disfmarker} that's its power , I guess , because uh a regular programmable uh remote control contains , well , uh really a lot of buttons . At at least uh forty buttons . </s> Project Manager : Yeah . Yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : So it's it's quite s complicated to get uh to get used to . And this is quite s simple . </s> Project Manager : Yep . </s> Industrial Designer : You can use your voice to to programme it . It's {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : Yeah . Okay , um let's give it a number . I'll give it uh a one .

I I've {disfmarker} I think we've uh succe succeed in in developing a product that's actually quite good , but not for this kind of market , and not for this kind of price . </s> User Interface : {vocalsound} {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : Yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : So {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : So high quality , low acceptance . </s> Industrial Designer : Hmm .",

Thank you . </s> User Interface : {vocalsound} </s> Industrial Designer : Okay , um I wanted to explain the working design of the remote control . It's possibly very handy if you want to uh design one of those . Um {vocalsound} well so it basically works uh as I uh uh r wrote down uh in this uh little uh summary . Uh when you press a button , {vocalsound} uh that's when you do pr for example when you uh want to turn up the volume , um a little connection is made uh the the rubber uh {vocalsound} button just presses on a </s> Project Manager : Sorry . {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : {gap} </s> User Interface : {vocalsound} </s> Industrial Designer : on a little print plate uh which uh makes uh uh {vocalsound} a connection that uh gives the chips , uh which is uh mounted beneath those uh that plastic of a rubber button . Uh senses that a connection has been made , and know and knows what button you pressed , becau uh for example the the volume up or volume down button . Um uh the the chip uh makes a Morse code uh like uh signal which uh then is si uh signalled {vocalsound} to uh several transistors which makes uh which sends the signal to a little let . You know what a let is ? </s> User Interface : Yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : Okay . {vocalsound} And that makes uh the the infra-red lights signal which is sent to the television set . Uh which has a sensor in it to uh sense uh the signal of the infra-red . That's basically uh how it works . Um the findings uh uh that I found uh searching up some uh detailed information about the remote controls , are that uh they are very easy to produce , uh it is pis uh it's possible to uh make them in mass production because it is as eas it is as easy as uh printing a page , uh just uh fibreglass plate um is b uh is uh covered with uh some uh coatings and uh uh {vocalsound} and chips . </s> User Interface : {vocalsound} </s> Industrial Designer : Uh and the technology's already available , we don't have to find out how remote controls uh have to work or uh how that how uh to make some chips that are possible to uh to to transmit those uh signals . Uh I made a little uh uh animation of {vocalsound} about how a tran our uh remote controller works . </s> User Interface : {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : {gap} </s> User Interface : Oh right . </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} Animation . {vocalsound} </s> User Interface : {vocalsound} </s> Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} we tel </s> User Interface : There is something turning . </s> Industrial Designer : There . </s> Project Manager : Yeah , it's a little bug it's in the in the smart board . {vocalsound} </s> Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Okay . Uh well </s> User Interface : {vocalsound} </s> Industrial Designer : the sub-component , I suppose that you understand what a sub-component is , is f in this example it's the button . Uh when it is pressed down , um , the switch is ter is uh is switched on , so with uh the wire is sent to the to the chip in uh co-operation with the battery of course , because to make uh a a signal possible you have to have some sort of uh li uh a d ad uh electronic uh {disfmarker} </s> User Interface : {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : Infrared light . </s> Industrial Designer : Yes , uh , okay . Um w after it's being composed by the chip uh the signal uh is transported uh to the infra-red bulb , and from there it signals a Morse code-like signal to the to the b to the bulb in uh in the television set . Okay . S Uh I wrote down some personal preferences about uh the remote control . Of course it is very handy if the remote control is hand held , so you don't have to uh uh wind it up or something , or just is it's it's very light to uh to make uh to use it . Uh I personally uh pref prefer that uh it would be p uh come available in the various colours , and uh easy to use buttons . But I suppose that the one of the other team members uh uh thought of that uh too . {vocalsound} </s> User Interface : Yeah , I've got it there too . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} </s> Industrial Designer : And it is possible for several designs and um easy to use b uh sorry , easy to use buttons . Perhaps soft touch , uh touch screen uh buttons because uh the rubber buttons are always uh uh they uh slightly uh they can be slightly damaged , </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} </s> Industrial Designer : uh so the numbers on the buttons are not possible uh to read anymore . And uh well as I said uh before th uh we can uh make several designs . {vocalsound} </s> User Interface : Yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : Okay , well , that's my contribution to this meeting , and uh </s> Marketing : To this meeting . {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : Okay , thank you . </s> User Interface : {vocalsound} </s> Industrial Designer : two of these this meeting . So . </s> User Interface : Shall I go uh next ? </s> Project Manager : Yep . </s> User Interface : 'Kay . </s> Project Manager : Please . </s> User Interface : So . </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} Smoking . </s> User Interface : Well uh , my name's {gap} , and I looked at uh technical functions design of the remote . Uh I did this by uh looking at examples of other remote controls , of how they uh they look , and information from the web that I found . Um well what I found was that uh th the actual use of the remote control is to send messages to television set , how you uh d what you described uh just early . And this can be all sorts of medsa messages , turn it on , turn it off , uh change the channel , adjust volume , that kind of thing . Uh play video , teletext , but also t uh play C_D_ if you use it your C_D_ player the remote control will that one . There are some uh examples of remote controls . You can see they are very different . The one has got all the functions that you could possibly need and an lot of uh buttons etcetera . And the other is uh more user friendly , little with big buttons . And uh not n all the the the the stuff you can do with it , but uh the the essential stuff is there . Um {vocalsound} I guess you could better y you should look at a a user centred uh approach , because the customers have to use them and and if they don't think it's usable they won't uh buy it . A lot of buttons they may think from I don't need s as much as that . Uh , well perf personal preferences is is uh a simple remote , with uh the basic functions that you can need that you could use . But uh keep in mind the new functions of T_V_ what we discussed earlier , split screen and uh is that a function that you should have ? Because all the T_V_s will have them . Or because of only a few and isn't really necessary . And then uh make it {disfmarker} I would make so that you can could uh use it on more than one appliance . If you have one that uh uh does with the vi the the video , it could also work with uh with the stereo , because play is play and stop stop and that sort of thing . The shu c you could reuse the buttons so that you don't have to have a lot of buttons for uh anything . And it should be a user friendly , clear buttons , and not too much . And that is my presentation . </s> Project Manager : Okay , thank you . </s> Industrial Designer : Okay . {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : 'Kay . Check . {vocalsound} </s> Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} </s> User Interface : You must still have it open . </s> Marketing : Kijke {gap} 'Kay , so . {vocalsound} We're going to j discuss the functional requirements of the remote , that m that means that functions user n want to have on the remote control , or just {disfmarker} Yeah , and the users , actually . </s> Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : The methods I I prefer is we're going to look which section of the users we are going to focus a l on more . Are the younger people going to buy the remote control or the elderly people ? And then {disfmarker} tho that section we're going to focus and adjust the remote more to that section than the whole user section . Okay . Some data . Younger people , from sixteen to thir forty five um years are more interested in fj features like L_C_D_ screens , speech recognition e etcetera . And we possess about two third of the market from in that range of age . The elderly people , from forty five years to sixty five years are not that much interested in features , and we possess less than two third , that's two fifth , of the market share in that area . {gap} Goed so . </s> Project Manager : {vocalsound} </s> Industrial Designer : Hmm . </s> Marketing : 'Kay . Findings . Fifty percent of the users lose their remote often . </s> User Interface : {vocalsound} Yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : So we don't have to make it very small , like uh like a mobile phone or something , but some somewhat bi bigger than small , so you don't lose it that much anymore . {vocalsound} Seventy five percent of the users also find it ugly , </s> Industrial Designer : Mm . </s> Marketing : and fif seventy five of the users zap a lot , so the buttons sh should be that small , or shouldn't be that complex because we have to search for the buttons , which one are you going to use . Next . Important issues about the remote . I think it would be better with a personal reference , but okay . Remote control has to have to have a low power usage , because s w seventy five percent of the users only zap one time an hour , so the power usage is also one one time an hour , or so , with a high power usage we would use a lot of but batteries . The volume button and the channel buttons are the two most important buttons on the remote control , so those {disfmarker} they {disfmarker} those have to h be find very easily . And have to be somewhat like bigger etcetera . It has also be {disfmarker} have to find easily when the label is gone . My colleague also announced it that labels should be scratched off </s> Industrial Designer : Mm . </s> User Interface : Hmm . </s> Marketing : or would be s uh {gap} senden {gap} </s> User Interface : {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : okay . {vocalsound} So uh if that's k uh if that's the problem , you also have to find it easily on the remote . Buttons . Like what all colleagues said , have to have to be minimalized . or should be covered , or in L_C_D_ screen . L_C_D_ screen is easy because we have the L_C_D_ screen , we have the various options . Put one option and then you have the all the buttons of that options , so the other options would be gone . And you don't see the buttons . So L_C_D_ screens should be easy , but an L_C_D_ screen , the problem with the L_ sc L_C_D_ screen is that elderly people fr from forty five to for sixty five years don't use the L_C_D_ screen a lot . So we have to that keep that in mind that if you're going to implement L_C_D_ screen , you don't have to make it that hard to learn or to use . </s> Industrial Designer : Uh L_C_D_ screen as in uh touch screen ? </s> Marketing : Yeah , touch screen , yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : Okay . </s> Marketing : The last but not least , younger people are more critical about the features . Because they use the remote control often more often , and are more technical than the ol older people . And the older people spend more money , and easily on a remote control . </s> User Interface : Mm . </s> Industrial Designer : 'Kay . </s> Marketing : So we have to keep in mind to to focus not a lot {disfmarker} not that much on the younger pep younger people , but also somewhat on the elderly people . And on my personal preferences , I don't have any mo more time to come with that , </s> User Interface : {vocalsound} {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : but like I said , L_C_D_ screen is easily to use </s> Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : because you have {disfmarker} you can implement a lot of buttons in one remote with not that much buttons . And it should be easy to use . Especially the volume buttons , the channel buttes buttons and the number buttons to zap through the channels . And that is it . </s> Project Manager : Okay , </s> Industrial Designer : Okay . {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : thank you .",

Uh I did this by uh looking at examples of other remote controls , of how they uh they look , and information from the web that I found . Um well what I found was that uh th the actual use of the remote control is to send messages to television set , how you uh d what you described uh just early . And this can be all sorts of medsa messages , turn it on , turn it off , uh change the channel , adjust volume , that kind of thing . Uh play video , teletext , but also t uh play C_D_ if you use it your C_D_ player the remote control will that one . There are some uh examples of remote controls . You can see they are very different . The one has got all the functions that you could possibly need and an lot of uh buttons etcetera . And the other is uh more user friendly , little with big buttons . And uh not n all the the the the stuff you can do with it , but uh the the essential stuff is there . Um {vocalsound} I guess you could better y you should look at a a user centred uh approach , because the customers have to use them and and if they don't think it's usable they won't uh buy it . A lot of buttons they may think from I don't need s as much as that . Uh , well perf personal preferences is is uh a simple remote , with uh the basic functions that you can need that you could use . But uh keep in mind the new functions of T_V_ what we discussed earlier , split screen and uh is that a function that you should have ? Because all the T_V_s will have them . Or because of only a few and isn't really necessary . And then uh make it {disfmarker} I would make so that you can could uh use it on more than one appliance . If you have one that uh uh does with the vi the the video , it could also work with uh with the stereo , because play is play and stop stop and that sort of thing . The shu c you could reuse the buttons so that you don't have to have a lot of buttons for uh anything . And it should be a user friendly , clear buttons , and not too much . And that is my presentation . </s> Project Manager : Okay , thank you . </s> Industrial Designer : Okay . {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : 'Kay . Check . {vocalsound} </s> Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} </s> User Interface : You must still have it open . </s> Marketing : Kijke {gap} 'Kay , so . {vocalsound} We're going to j discuss the functional requirements of the remote , that m that means that functions user n want to have on the remote control , or just {disfmarker} Yeah , and the users , actually . </s> Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : The methods I I prefer is we're going to look which section of the users we are going to focus a l on more . Are the younger people going to buy the remote control or the elderly people ? And then {disfmarker} tho that section we're going to focus and adjust the remote more to that section than the whole user section . Okay . Some data . Younger people , from sixteen to thir forty five um years are more interested in fj features like L_C_D_ screens , speech recognition e etcetera . And we possess about two third of the market from in that range of age . The elderly people , from forty five years to sixty five years are not that much interested in features , and we possess less than two third , that's two fifth , of the market share in that area . {gap} Goed so . </s> Project Manager : {vocalsound} </s> Industrial Designer : Hmm . </s> Marketing : 'Kay . Findings . Fifty percent of the users lose their remote often . </s> User Interface : {vocalsound} Yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : So we don't have to make it very small , like uh like a mobile phone or something , but some somewhat bi bigger than small , so you don't lose it that much anymore . {vocalsound} Seventy five percent of the users also find it ugly , </s> Industrial Designer : Mm . </s> Marketing : and fif seventy five of the users zap a lot , so the buttons sh should be that small , or shouldn't be that complex because we have to search for the buttons , which one are you going to use . Next . Important issues about the remote . I think it would be better with a personal reference , but okay . Remote control has to have to have a low power usage , because s w seventy five percent of the users only zap one time an hour , so the power usage is also one one time an hour , or so , with a high power usage we would use a lot of but batteries . The volume button and the channel buttons are the two most important buttons on the remote control , so those {disfmarker} they {disfmarker} those have to h be find very easily . And have to be somewhat like bigger etcetera . It has also be {disfmarker} have to find easily when the label is gone . My colleague also announced it that labels should be scratched off </s> Industrial Designer : Mm . </s> User Interface : Hmm . </s> Marketing : or would be s uh {gap} senden {gap} </s> User Interface : {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : okay . {vocalsound} So uh if that's k uh if that's the problem , you also have to find it easily on the remote . Buttons . Like what all colleagues said , have to have to be minimalized . or should be covered , or in L_C_D_ screen . L_C_D_ screen is easy because we have the L_C_D_ screen , we have the various options . Put one option and then you have the all the buttons of that options , so the other options would be gone . And you don't see the buttons . So L_C_D_ screens should be easy , but an L_C_D_ screen , the problem with the L_ sc L_C_D_ screen is that elderly people fr from forty five to for sixty five years don't use the L_C_D_ screen a lot . So we have to that keep that in mind that if you're going to implement L_C_D_ screen , you don't have to make it that hard to learn or to use . </s> Industrial Designer : Uh L_C_D_ screen as in uh touch screen ? </s> Marketing : Yeah , touch screen , yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : Okay . </s> Marketing : The last but not least , younger people are more critical about the features . Because they use the remote control often more often , and are more technical than the ol older people . And the older people spend more money , and easily on a remote control . </s> User Interface : Mm . </s> Industrial Designer : 'Kay . </s> Marketing : So we have to keep in mind to to focus not a lot {disfmarker} not that much on the younger pep younger people , but also somewhat on the elderly people . And on my personal preferences , I don't have any mo more time to come with that , </s> User Interface : {vocalsound} {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : but like I said , L_C_D_ screen is easily to use </s> Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : because you have {disfmarker} you can implement a lot of buttons in one remote with not that much buttons .

Uh I did this by uh looking at examples of other remote controls , of how they uh they look , and information from the web that I found . Um well what I found was that uh th the actual use of the remote control is to send messages to television set , how you uh d what you described uh just early . And this can be all sorts of medsa messages , turn it on , turn it off , uh change the channel , adjust volume , that kind of thing . Uh play video , teletext , but also t uh play C_D_ if you use it your C_D_ player the remote control will that one . There are some uh examples of remote controls . You can see they are very different . The one has got all the functions that you could possibly need and an lot of uh buttons etcetera . And the other is uh more user friendly , little with big buttons . And uh not n all the the the the stuff you can do with it , but uh the the essential stuff is there . Um {vocalsound} I guess you could better y you should look at a a user centred uh approach , because the customers have to use them and and if they don't think it's usable they won't uh buy it . A lot of buttons they may think from I don't need s as much as that . Uh , well perf personal preferences is is uh a simple remote , with uh the basic functions that you can need that you could use . But uh keep in mind the new functions of T_V_ what we discussed earlier , split screen and uh is that a function that you should have ? Because all the T_V_s will have them . Or because of only a few and isn't really necessary . And then uh make it {disfmarker} I would make so that you can could uh use it on more than one appliance . If you have one that uh uh does with the vi the the video , it could also work with uh with the stereo , because play is play and stop stop and that sort of thing . The shu c you could reuse the buttons so that you don't have to have a lot of buttons for uh anything . And it should be a user friendly , clear buttons , and not too much . And that is my presentation . </s> Project Manager : Okay , thank you . </s> Industrial Designer : Okay . {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : 'Kay . Check . {vocalsound} </s> Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} </s> User Interface : You must still have it open . </s> Marketing : Kijke {gap} 'Kay , so . {vocalsound} We're going to j discuss the functional requirements of the remote , that m that means that functions user n want to have on the remote control , or just {disfmarker} Yeah , and the users , actually . </s> Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : The methods I I prefer is we're going to look which section of the users we are going to focus a l on more . Are the younger people going to buy the remote control or the elderly people ? And then {disfmarker} tho that section we're going to focus and adjust the remote more to that section than the whole user section . Okay . Some data . Younger people , from sixteen to thir forty five um years are more interested in fj features like L_C_D_ screens , speech recognition e etcetera . And we possess about two third of the market from in that range of age . The elderly people , from forty five years to sixty five years are not that much interested in features , and we possess less than two third , that's two fifth , of the market share in that area . {gap} Goed so . </s> Project Manager : {vocalsound} </s> Industrial Designer : Hmm . </s> Marketing : 'Kay . Findings . Fifty percent of the users lose their remote often . </s> User Interface : {vocalsound} Yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : So we don't have to make it very small , like uh like a mobile phone or something , but some somewhat bi bigger than small , so you don't lose it that much anymore . {vocalsound} Seventy five percent of the users also find it ugly , </s> Industrial Designer : Mm . </s> Marketing : and fif seventy five of the users zap a lot , so the buttons sh should be that small , or shouldn't be that complex because we have to search for the buttons , which one are you going to use . Next . Important issues about the remote . I think it would be better with a personal reference , but okay . Remote control has to have to have a low power usage , because s w seventy five percent of the users only zap one time an hour , so the power usage is also one one time an hour , or so , with a high power usage we would use a lot of but batteries . The volume button and the channel buttons are the two most important buttons on the remote control , so those {disfmarker} they {disfmarker} those have to h be find very easily . And have to be somewhat like bigger etcetera . It has also be {disfmarker} have to find easily when the label is gone . My colleague also announced it that labels should be scratched off </s> Industrial Designer : Mm . </s> User Interface : Hmm . </s> Marketing : or would be s uh {gap} senden {gap} </s> User Interface : {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : okay . {vocalsound} So uh if that's k uh if that's the problem , you also have to find it easily on the remote . Buttons . Like what all colleagues said , have to have to be minimalized . or should be covered , or in L_C_D_ screen . L_C_D_ screen is easy because we have the L_C_D_ screen , we have the various options . Put one option and then you have the all the buttons of that options , so the other options would be gone . And you don't see the buttons . So L_C_D_ screens should be easy , but an L_C_D_ screen , the problem with the L_ sc L_C_D_ screen is that elderly people fr from forty five to for sixty five years don't use the L_C_D_ screen a lot . So we have to that keep that in mind that if you're going to implement L_C_D_ screen , you don't have to make it that hard to learn or to use . </s> Industrial Designer : Uh L_C_D_ screen as in uh touch screen ? </s> Marketing : Yeah , touch screen , yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : Okay . </s> Marketing : The last but not least , younger people are more critical about the features . Because they use the remote control often more often , and are more technical than the ol older people . And the older people spend more money , and easily on a remote control . </s> User Interface : Mm . </s> Industrial Designer : 'Kay . </s> Marketing : So we have to keep in mind to to focus not a lot {disfmarker} not that much on the younger pep younger people , but also somewhat on the elderly people . And on my personal preferences , I don't have any mo more time to come with that , </s> User Interface : {vocalsound} {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : but like I said , L_C_D_ screen is easily to use </s> Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : because you have {disfmarker} you can implement a lot of buttons in one remote with not that much buttons . And it should be easy to use . Especially the volume buttons , the channel buttes buttons and the number buttons to zap through the channels .

You can see they are very different . The one has got all the functions that you could possibly need and an lot of uh buttons etcetera .

Um {vocalsound} I guess you could better y you should look at a a user centred uh approach , because the customers have to use them and and if they don't think it's usable they won't uh buy it . A lot of buttons they may think from I don't need s as much as that . Uh , well perf personal preferences is is uh a simple remote , with uh the basic functions that you can need that you could use .

If you have one that uh uh does with the vi the the video , it could also work with uh with the stereo , because play is play and stop stop and that sort of thing . The shu c you could reuse the buttons so that you don't have to have a lot of buttons for uh anything . And it should be a user friendly , clear buttons , and not too much . And that is my presentation . </s> Project Manager : Okay , thank you . </s> Industrial Designer : Okay . {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : 'Kay . Check . {vocalsound} </s> Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} </s> User Interface : You must still have it open . </s> Marketing : Kijke {gap} 'Kay , so . {vocalsound} We're going to j discuss the functional requirements of the remote , that m that means that functions user n want to have on the remote control , or just {disfmarker} Yeah , and the users , actually . </s> Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : The methods I I prefer is we're going to look which section of the users we are going to focus a l on more . Are the younger people going to buy the remote control or the elderly people ? And then {disfmarker} tho that section we're going to focus and adjust the remote more to that section than the whole user section . Okay . Some data . Younger people , from sixteen to thir forty five um years are more interested in fj features like L_C_D_ screens , speech recognition e etcetera . And we possess about two third of the market from in that range of age . The elderly people , from forty five years to sixty five years are not that much interested in features , and we possess less than two third , that's two fifth , of the market share in that area . {gap} Goed so . </s> Project Manager : {vocalsound} </s> Industrial Designer : Hmm . </s> Marketing : 'Kay . Findings . Fifty percent of the users lose their remote often . </s> User Interface : {vocalsound} Yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : So we don't have to make it very small , like uh like a mobile phone or something , but some somewhat bi bigger than small , so you don't lose it that much anymore . {vocalsound} Seventy five percent of the users also find it ugly , </s> Industrial Designer : Mm . </s> Marketing : and fif seventy five of the users zap a lot , so the buttons sh should be that small , or shouldn't be that complex because we have to search for the buttons , which one are you going to use . Next . Important issues about the remote . I think it would be better with a personal reference , but okay . Remote control has to have to have a low power usage , because s w seventy five percent of the users only zap one time an hour , so the power usage is also one one time an hour , or so , with a high power usage we would use a lot of but batteries . The volume button and the channel buttons are the two most important buttons on the remote control , so those {disfmarker} they {disfmarker} those have to h be find very easily . And have to be somewhat like bigger etcetera . It has also be {disfmarker} have to find easily when the label is gone . My colleague also announced it that labels should be scratched off </s> Industrial Designer : Mm . </s> User Interface : Hmm . </s> Marketing : or would be s uh {gap} senden {gap} </s> User Interface : {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : okay . {vocalsound} So uh if that's k uh if that's the problem , you also have to find it easily on the remote . Buttons . Like what all colleagues said , have to have to be minimalized . or should be covered , or in L_C_D_ screen . L_C_D_ screen is easy because we have the L_C_D_ screen , we have the various options . Put one option and then you have the all the buttons of that options , so the other options would be gone . And you don't see the buttons . So L_C_D_ screens should be easy , but an L_C_D_ screen , the problem with the L_ sc L_C_D_ screen is that elderly people fr from forty five to for sixty five years don't use the L_C_D_ screen a lot . So we have to that keep that in mind that if you're going to implement L_C_D_ screen , you don't have to make it that hard to learn or to use . </s> Industrial Designer : Uh L_C_D_ screen as in uh touch screen ? </s> Marketing : Yeah , touch screen , yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : Okay . </s> Marketing : The last but not least , younger people are more critical about the features . Because they use the remote control often more often , and are more technical than the ol older people . And the older people spend more money , and easily on a remote control . </s> User Interface : Mm . </s> Industrial Designer : 'Kay . </s> Marketing : So we have to keep in mind to to focus not a lot {disfmarker} not that much on the younger pep younger people , but also somewhat on the elderly people . And on my personal preferences , I don't have any mo more time to come with that , </s> User Interface : {vocalsound} {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : but like I said , L_C_D_ screen is easily to use </s> Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : because you have {disfmarker} you can implement a lot of buttons in one remote with not that much buttons .

Check . {vocalsound} </s> Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} </s> User Interface : You must still have it open . </s> Marketing : Kijke {gap} 'Kay , so . {vocalsound} We're going to j discuss the functional requirements of the remote , that m that means that functions user n want to have on the remote control , or just {disfmarker} Yeah , and the users , actually . </s> Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : The methods I I prefer is we're going to look which section of the users we are going to focus a l on more . Are the younger people going to buy the remote control or the elderly people ? And then {disfmarker} tho that section we're going to focus and adjust the remote more to that section than the whole user section . Okay . Some data . Younger people , from sixteen to thir forty five um years are more interested in fj features like L_C_D_ screens , speech recognition e etcetera . And we possess about two third of the market from in that range of age . The elderly people , from forty five years to sixty five years are not that much interested in features , and we possess less than two third , that's two fifth , of the market share in that area . {gap} Goed so . </s> Project Manager : {vocalsound} </s> Industrial Designer : Hmm . </s> Marketing : 'Kay . Findings . Fifty percent of the users lose their remote often . </s> User Interface : {vocalsound} Yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : So we don't have to make it very small , like uh like a mobile phone or something , but some somewhat bi bigger than small , so you don't lose it that much anymore . {vocalsound} Seventy five percent of the users also find it ugly , </s> Industrial Designer : Mm . </s> Marketing : and fif seventy five of the users zap a lot , so the buttons sh should be that small , or shouldn't be that complex because we have to search for the buttons , which one are you going to use . Next . Important issues about the remote . I think it would be better with a personal reference , but okay . Remote control has to have to have a low power usage , because s w seventy five percent of the users only zap one time an hour , so the power usage is also one one time an hour , or so , with a high power usage we would use a lot of but batteries . The volume button and the channel buttons are the two most important buttons on the remote control , so those {disfmarker} they {disfmarker} those have to h be find very easily . And have to be somewhat like bigger etcetera . It has also be {disfmarker} have to find easily when the label is gone . My colleague also announced it that labels should be scratched off </s> Industrial Designer : Mm . </s> User Interface : Hmm . </s> Marketing : or would be s uh {gap} senden {gap} </s> User Interface : {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : okay . {vocalsound} So uh if that's k uh if that's the problem , you also have to find it easily on the remote . Buttons . Like what all colleagues said , have to have to be minimalized . or should be covered , or in L_C_D_ screen . L_C_D_ screen is easy because we have the L_C_D_ screen , we have the various options . Put one option and then you have the all the buttons of that options , so the other options would be gone . And you don't see the buttons . So L_C_D_ screens should be easy , but an L_C_D_ screen , the problem with the L_ sc L_C_D_ screen is that elderly people fr from forty five to for sixty five years don't use the L_C_D_ screen a lot . So we have to that keep that in mind that if you're going to implement L_C_D_ screen , you don't have to make it that hard to learn or to use . </s> Industrial Designer : Uh L_C_D_ screen as in uh touch screen ? </s> Marketing : Yeah , touch screen , yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : Okay . </s> Marketing : The last but not least , younger people are more critical about the features . Because they use the remote control often more often , and are more technical than the ol older people . And the older people spend more money , and easily on a remote control . </s> User Interface : Mm . </s> Industrial Designer : 'Kay . </s> Marketing : So we have to keep in mind to to focus not a lot {disfmarker} not that much on the younger pep younger people , but also somewhat on the elderly people .

Okay . S Uh I wrote down some personal preferences about uh the remote control . Of course it is very handy if the remote control is hand held , so you don't have to uh uh wind it up or something , or just is it's it's very light to uh to make uh to use it .

Uh I did this by uh looking at examples of other remote controls , of how they uh they look , and information from the web that I found .

And this can be all sorts of medsa messages , turn it on , turn it off , uh change the channel , adjust volume , that kind of thing . Uh play video , teletext , but also t uh play C_D_ if you use it your C_D_ player the remote control will that one . There are some uh examples of remote controls .

And the other is uh more user friendly , little with big buttons . And uh not n all the the the the stuff you can do with it , but uh the the essential stuff is there . Um {vocalsound} I guess you could better y you should look at a a user centred uh approach , because the customers have to use them and and if they don't think it's usable they won't uh buy it . A lot of buttons they may think from I don't need s as much as that . Uh , well perf personal preferences is is uh a simple remote , with uh the basic functions that you can need that you could use . But uh keep in mind the new functions of T_V_ what we discussed earlier , split screen and uh is that a function that you should have ? Because all the T_V_s will have them .

If you have one that uh uh does with the vi the the video , it could also work with uh with the stereo , because play is play and stop stop and that sort of thing .

Delivery of the plan will be led by a national implementation board that will be accountable to Ministers. Which Minister do you believe it should be accountable to, or, given the complexity of obesity, should the board be directly accountable to the First Minister? </s> Dr Frank Atherton : Ultimately, the First Minister will be responsible for this and will want to have a strong oversight of this. It is often framed as a health issue, and the Minister, Vaughan Gething, has a strong personal commitment to this, I know. We've talked extensively with him and with sports and recreation colleagues about that, so there's a link there. It does cut across all portfolios, and so this is an issue that I have discussed with Cabinet, and that collective ownership is really important, and will be, because it can't just sit in one domain. I think what you do need to have is you do need to have a lead organisation or a lead ministry, and I would see health as\u2014I work within health, so I'm perhaps biased, but I would see health as leading this, but it needs broad ownership across Government. </s> Janet Finch-Saunders AM : I know my colleague Si\u00e2n Gwenllian mentioned earlier targets and things, but I know in Wales we're not too good at collecting data. What data is currently available on childhood obesity and what metrics will be used to measure progress against the plan's objectives? </s> Dr Frank Atherton : Well, of course, our main data source is the child measurement programme, which collects information on children entering school aged four or five. That's our main source of information. If we look at that data, it shows us\u2014. Well, I'm sure you're familiar with the statistics, but it'll be just under a third of children at that age who are overweight or obese\u2014 </s> Janet Finch-Saunders AM : Could I just ask\u2014sorry to interrupt\u2014how up to date is that? </s> Dr Frank Atherton : The last survey was just last year. </s> Nathan Cook : The data was published last week. </s> Dr Frank Atherton : Yes, the lastest data was out last week. </s> Janet Finch-Saunders AM : It is pretty up to date. </s> Dr Frank Atherton : So, it's pretty up to date, and what it shows\u2014. It's not getting radically worse\u2014there's always statistical variation in these things\u2014but it's not getting any better. And, for the first time last year, we did look at the question not just of children who were overweight or obese, but we actually singled out the proportion who are obese, severely obese. So we have a figure for that for the first time, which is about 12 per cent, which is quite shocking, in a way. </s> Janet Finch-Saunders AM : It is shocking. </s> Dr Frank Atherton : So, that's our main source of information. Does that answer your question? </s> Janet Finch-Saunders AM : Yes, but how will any gaps in your data be addressed? </s> Dr Frank Atherton : Well, one of the questions that are often asked is: could we measure more on a longitudinal basis? By that I mean in England, for example, children are measured at school entry and then again at year 11\u2014at age 11 or 12., that kind of age group. And so you do have a longitudinal view over time of what's happening to children. I think that would be helpful to us in Wales, and it's one of the questions in the consultation about whether we should expand that. Obviously, that would have significant resource implications, not just for the funding, but also for schools and for the system to deliver it. But it's something that maybe would help us in terms of better understanding and better evaluation\u2014the point that was made earlier. </s> Nathan Cook : And the other data we do have is the millennium cohort study, which has been released, for 14 and 15-year-olds. That's going to be\u2014. We're starting to think about how we can utilise some of that data, looking at that longitudinal picture around children as well, which will be really helpful. </s> Janet Finch-Saunders AM : Thank you. You've answered my next question. Thank you. </s> Lynne Neagle AM : Can I just ask about the child measurement programme? The strategy commits to looking at whether we can have a second measurement taking place in Wales. Can you just tell us a bit more about your thinking on that and when you would see a second measurement taking place and how you would use that data? </s> Dr Frank Atherton : I touched on that just now, but personally I do think it would be helpful to have more information. It's always the case, There's always a trade-off between the cost of getting that information and the value of the information. So, the question of how it would be used would be really important. There is still a lot that we don't know. We know an awful lot about obesity and being overweight and the causes of it, but we don't really have a very clear understanding, in Wales at least, of the point at which children start to become overweight. Although we know that overweight children tend to go on to become overweight adults, we don't know what proportion of them between school entry and later teenage years\u2014what those changes are. So, it would help us to have some better understanding, which would help to direct some of our initiatives. I'd be generally supportive of the principle. We'll wait and see what comes out in the consultation, and it's something that we need to give thought to,\u00a0 but we do have to trade off the additionality of what the information would give us with the cost of doing that, of course.",

By that I mean in England, for example, children are measured at school entry and then again at year 11\u2014at age 11 or 12., that kind of age group. And so you do have a longitudinal view over time of what's happening to children. I think that would be helpful to us in Wales, and it's one of the questions in the consultation about whether we should expand that. Obviously, that would have significant resource implications, not just for the funding, but also for schools and for the system to deliver it. But it's something that maybe would help us in terms of better understanding and better evaluation\u2014the point that was made earlier. </s> Nathan Cook : And the other data we do have is the millennium cohort study, which has been released, for 14 and 15-year-olds. That's going to be\u2014. We're starting to think about how we can utilise some of that data, looking at that longitudinal picture around children as well, which will be really helpful. </s> Janet Finch-Saunders AM : Thank you. You've answered my next question. Thank you. </s> Lynne Neagle AM : Can I just ask about the child measurement programme? The strategy commits to looking at whether we can have a second measurement taking place in Wales. Can you just tell us a bit more about your thinking on that and when you would see a second measurement taking place and how you would use that data? </s> Dr Frank Atherton : I touched on that just now, but personally I do think it would be helpful to have more information. It's always the case, There's always a trade-off between the cost of getting that information and the value of the information. So, the question of how it would be used would be really important. There is still a lot that we don't know. We know an awful lot about obesity and being overweight and the causes of it, but we don't really have a very clear understanding, in Wales at least, of the point at which children start to become overweight. Although we know that overweight children tend to go on to become overweight adults, we don't know what proportion of them between school entry and later teenage years\u2014what those changes are. So, it would help us to have some better understanding, which would help to direct some of our initiatives. I'd be generally supportive of the principle. We'll wait and see what comes out in the consultation, and it's something that we need to give thought to,\u00a0 but we do have to trade off the additionality of what the information would give us with the cost of doing that, of course.",

No , this is very straightforward . </s> Professor B : Great . So this is just trying to {disfmarker} It 's a design thing , not a political thing .

And , um {disfmarker} And , uh {disfmarker} However , the , uh {disfmarker} e So that you understand , it is really simple . Uh {disfmarker} You {disfmarker} you have a route , and you cut it up in different pieces . And every {disfmarker} every element of that e r r f of that {disfmarker} Every segment we call a \" route element \" . And so , from A to B we cut up in three different steps , and every step has a \" from object \" where you start , a \" to object \" where y where {pause} you sort of end , and some points of interest along the way . What w I was sort of missing here , and uh , maybe it was just me being too stupid , is , {vocalsound} I didn't sort of get the {disfmarker} the notion of the global goal of the whole route . Really , s was not straightforward visibly for me . And some other stuff . And I {vocalsound} suggested that they should n be {disfmarker} k uh , kind enough to do s two things for us , is one , um , {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Also allocating , uh , some tags for our Action Schema Enter - Vista - Approach , and {disfmarker} And also , um , since you had suggested that {disfmarker} that , um , we figure out if we ever , for a demo reason , wanted to shortcut directly to the g GIS and the Planner , of how we can do it . Now , what 's the state of the art of getting to entrances , um , what 's the syntax for that , how get getting to {vocalsound} vista points and calculating those on the spot . And the Approach mode , anyhow , is the default . That 's all they do it these days . Wherever you 'll find a route planner it n does nothing but get to the closest point where the street network is {vocalsound} at minimal distance to the geometric center . </s> Professor B : Mm - hmm . </s> Grad C :  So . </s> Professor B : So , well , let {disfmarker} Now , this is important . Let , uh {disfmarker} I want a a Again , outside of m almost managerial point , um {disfmarker} You 're in the midst of this , so you know better . But it seems to me it 's probably a good idea to li uh {disfmarker} minimize the number of uh , change requests we make of them . So it seemed to me , what we ought to do is get our story together . OK ? And think about it some , internally , before asking them to make changes . </s> Grad C : Mm - hmm . </s> Professor B : Oh . Does this {disfmarker} does this make sense to you guys ? It {disfmarker} I mean you 're {disfmarker} you 're doing the {disfmarker} the interaction but it seemed to me that {vocalsound} what we ought to do is come up with a {disfmarker} uh , something where you , um {disfmarker} And I {disfmarker} I don't know who 's mok working most closely on it . Probably Johno . OK . Uh , take what they have , send it to everybody saying \" this is what they have , this is what we think we should add \" , OK ? and then have a d a {disfmarker} an iteration within our group saying \" Hmm , well {disfmarker} \" OK ?

That 's right . So . So , Yeah . The problem isn't the short ra range optimization . It 's the sort of {disfmarker} o one or two year kind of thing . OK . What are the thl class of things we think we might try to do in a year or two ?

And this is what it {disfmarker} sort of is the {disfmarker} the structure of Map requests , um also not very interesting , and here is the more interesting stuff for us , is the routes , route elements , and , again , as we thought it 's really simple . This is sort of the , uh , {vocalsound} {vocalsound} um , {vocalsound} parameters .

No , this is very straightforward . </s> Professor B : Great . So this is just trying to {disfmarker} It 's a design thing , not a political thing . Once we 've {disfmarker} eh {disfmarker} We can just sort of agree on what oughta be done . </s> Grad C : Yeah . </s> Professor B : Good . </s> Grad C : Exactly . And , um {disfmarker} And , uh {disfmarker} However , the , uh {disfmarker} e So that you understand , it is really simple .

What w I was sort of missing here , and uh , maybe it was just me being too stupid , is , {vocalsound} I didn't sort of get the {disfmarker} the notion of the global goal of the whole route . Really , s was not straightforward visibly for me . And some other stuff . And I {vocalsound} suggested that they should n be {disfmarker} k uh , kind enough to do s two things for us , is one , um , {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Also allocating , uh , some tags for our Action Schema Enter - Vista - Approach , and {disfmarker} And also , um , since you had suggested that {disfmarker} that , um , we figure out if we ever , for a demo reason , wanted to shortcut directly to the g GIS and the Planner , of how we can do it . Now , what 's the state of the art of getting to entrances , um , what 's the syntax for that , how get getting to {vocalsound} vista points and calculating those on the spot .

So That 'd be great . It would be a good exercise to just see {vocalsound} whether one can get that to run . </s> Grad C : See th Mm - hmm . {vocalsound} Yep . And , um , </s> Grad D : So , that 's {disfmarker} </s> Grad C : that 's {disfmarker} shouldn't be too tough . </s> Grad D : Fine , yeah . Yeah , so where are those {disfmarker} those functions \" Action \" , \" Goodbye \" , and so on , right ? Are they actually , um , {vocalsound} Are they going to be called ? Um , are they present in the code for the parser ? </s> Grad C : Yeah . I think what it does , it i i it does something sort of fancy . It loads um {disfmarker} It has these style sheets and also the , um , schemata . So what it probably does , is it takes the , uh , {vocalsound} um {disfmarker} Is this where it is ? This is already the XML stuff ? This is where it takes its own , um , syntax , and converts it somehow . Um . Where is the uh {disfmarker} </s> Grad D : What are you looking for ? </s> Grad C : Um , where it actually produces the {disfmarker} the XML out of the , uh , parsed {pause} stuff . </s> Grad D : Oh , OK . </s> Grad C : No , this is not it . Uh . I can't find it now . You mean , where the {disfmarker} where the act how the action \" Goodbye \" maps into something {disfmarker} </s> Grad D : Yeah . </s> Grad A : Yeah , where are those constructors defined ? </s> Grad D : Oh . </s> Grad C : Nope . </s> Grad D : No , that 's not it . </s> Grad C : Yeah . This is sort of what happens . This is what you would need to {disfmarker} to change {disfmarker} to get the , uh , XML changed . So when it encounts encounters \" Day \" , {vocalsound} it will , uh , activate those h classes in the {disfmarker} in the XML stuff But , um {disfmarker} I saw those actions {disfmarker} uh , the \" Goodbye \" stuff somewhere . Hmm , hmm , hmm , hmm , hmm . </s> Grad A : Grep for it ? </s> Grad C : Yeah . Let 's do that . Oh . </s> Grad D : Mmm . M - three - L dot DTD ? </s> Grad C : Yep . </s> Grad D : That 's just a {pause} specification for the XML format . </s> Grad C : Yep . Well , we 'll find that out . So whatever {disfmarker} n this does {disfmarker} I mean this is , basically , looks l to me like a function call , right ? </s> Professor B : Hmm ? Oh , yeah . </s> Grad C : And , um {disfmarker} So , whenever it {disfmarker} it encounters \" Goodbye \" , which we can make it do in a second , here </s> Grad A : That function automatically generates an initialized XML structure ? </s> Grad C : I </s> Grad D : I think each of those functions act on the current XML structure , and change it in some way , for example , by adding a {disfmarker} a l a field to it , or something . </s> Professor B : y Yeah . They also seem to affect state , </s> Grad C : Mm - hmm . </s> Professor B : cause some of them {disfmarker} there were other actions uh , that {disfmarker} that s seemed to step {disfmarker} state variables somewhere , </s> Grad D : Right . </s> Professor B : like the n s \" Discourse Status Confirm \" . OK . So that 's going to be a call on the discourse </s> Grad C : Yep . </s> Professor B : and {vocalsound} confirm that it 's {disfmarker} </s> Grad C : W we Mm - hmm </s> Grad D : Oh , you mean that 's not going to actually modify the tree , </s> Professor B : I think that 's right . </s> Grad C : e </s> Grad D : but it 's going to change the event . </s> Professor B : I think it 's actually {disfmarker} That looks like it 's state modification . </s> Grad D : Oh . Oh . </s> Grad C : e mmm Um , well i There is a feature called \" Discourse - Status \" , </s> Grad D : When there 's a feature . </s> Professor B : Yeah . </s> Grad C : And so whenever I just say , \" Write \" , it will {disfmarker} it will put this in here . </s> Professor B : Oh , so it always just {disfmarker} Is it {disfmarker} So it {disfmarker} Well , go back , then , cuz it may be that all those th things , while they look like function calls , are just a way of adding exactly that to the XML . </s> Grad C : h Yep . </s> Professor B : Uh - huh ! I 'm not {disfmarker} I 'm not sure . </s> Grad C : So , this {disfmarker} </s> Professor B : e I 'm not sure {disfmarker} e that {disfmarker} </s> Grad C : Um {disfmarker} well , we {disfmarker} we 'll see , when we say , let 's test something , \" Goodbye \" , causes it to c to create basically an \" Action Goodbye - End - Action \" . </s> Professor B : Right . </s> Grad C : Which is a means of telling the system to shut down . </s> Professor B : Right . </s> Grad C : Now , if we know that \" Write \" produces a \" Feature Discourse - Status Confirm Discourse - Status \" . So if I now say \" Write , Goodbye , \" it should do that . It sho it creates this , </s> Grad D : Mm - hmm . </s> Professor B : Right . </s> Grad C : \" Confirm Goodbye \" . </s> Professor B : Yep . </s> Grad D : Right there . But there is some kind of function call , because how does it know to put Goodbye in Content , but , uh , Confirm in Features ? </s> Grad C : Oh . It d it {disfmarker} n That 's because {disfmarker} </s> Grad D : So So , it 's not just that it 's adding that field . </s> Professor B : Right . </s> Grad D : It 's </s> Professor B : Absolutely . Good point . </s> Grad D : OK . </s> Professor B : It 's {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} It 's under what sub - type you 're doing it . Yeah . </s> Grad C : Mm - hmm . Yeah . </s> Grad A : It 's mystery functions . </s> Grad C : Well , sometimes it m Sometimes , i </s> Grad D : Well , they 're defined somewhere , presumably . </s> Professor B : Yeah , each is {disfmarker} S so that 's funny . </s> Grad C : When it {disfmarker} </s> Professor B : You bury the s the state in the function Alright . </s> Grad C : it {disfmarker} </s> Grad A : Well , it just automatically initializes things that are common , right ? </s> Professor B : Uh </s> Grad A : So it 's just a shorthand . </s> Professor B : Yeah . </s> Grad C : For example {disfmarker} Oh , this is German . Sorry . e So , now , this , it cannot do anymore . Nothing comes out of here . </s> Grad A : A \" not a number \" is a value . Awesome . </s> Grad C : So , it doesn't speak German anymore , but it does speak English . And there is , here , a reference {disfmarker} So , this tells us that whatever is {disfmarker} has the ID \" zero \" is referenced here {disfmarker} by @ @ {comment} the restriction seed and this is exa \" I want {disfmarker} \" What was the sentence ? </s> Professor B : \" I want two seats here . \" </s> Grad C : \" need two seats here . \" Nuh . \" And where is it playing ? \" There should also be a reference to something , maybe . Our d This is re um Mmm . Here , we change {disfmarker} and so , we {disfmarker} Here we add something to the Discourse - Status , that the user wants to change something that was sort of done before And , uh {disfmarker} and that , whatever is being changed has something to do with the cinema . </s> Grad A : So then , whatever takes this M - three - L is what actually changes the state , not the {disfmarker} Yeah , OK . </s> Professor B : No , right , the Discourse Maintainer , </s> Grad A : Yeah . </s> Professor B : yeah . I see . And it {disfmarker} and it runs around looking for Discourse Status tags , and doing whatever it does with them . And other people ignore those tags . Alright . So , yeah . I definitely think it 's {disfmarker} {vocalsound} It 's worth the exercise of trying to actually add something that isn't there . </s> Grad C : Hmm ? </s> Professor B : Uh Disc </s> Grad C : Sort of get a complete understanding of the whole thing . </s> Professor B : Yeah , a kid understanding what 's going on . Then the next thing we talked about is actually , {vocalsound} um , figuring out how to add our own tags , and stuff like that . </s> Grad C : OK . Point number two . I got the , uh , M - three - L for the routes today . Uh , so I got some more . This is sort of the uh , {vocalsound} um , Hmm . Interesting . It 's just going up , it 's not going back down . So , this is {disfmarker} um , what I got today is {vocalsound} the {disfmarker} the new {vocalsound} um {vocalsound} M - three - L for um , {vocalsound} {vocalsound} the Maps , </s> Professor B : Yep . </s> Grad C : uh , and with some examples {disfmarker} So , this is the XML and this is sort of what it will look like later on , even though it {disfmarker} you can't see it on {disfmarker} on this resolution . And this is what it {disfmarker} sort of is the {disfmarker} the structure of Map requests , um also not very interesting , and here is the more interesting stuff for us , is the routes , route elements , and , again , as we thought it 's really simple . This is sort of the , uh , {vocalsound} {vocalsound} um , {vocalsound} parameters . We have @ @ {comment} simple \" from objects \" and \" to objects \" and so forth , points of interest along the way {disfmarker} And , um , I asked them whether or not we could , um {disfmarker} First of all , I was little bit {disfmarker} It seemed to me that this m way of doing it is sort of a stack a step backwards from the way we 've done it before . t It seems to me that some notions were missing . </s> Professor B : S </s> Grad C : So these are {disfmarker} these are {disfmarker} </s> Professor B : So these are {disfmarker} these are your friends back at EML . </s> Grad C : Yep . Who are doing this . </s> Professor B : So this is not a complicated negotiation . There 's {disfmarker} there 's not seven committees , or anything , right ? </s> Grad C : No . No , this is very straightforward . </s> Professor B : Great . So this is just trying to {disfmarker} It 's a design thing , not a political thing . Once we 've {disfmarker} eh {disfmarker} We can just sort of agree on what oughta be done . </s> Grad C : Yeah . </s> Professor B : Good . </s> Grad C : Exactly . And , um {disfmarker} And , uh {disfmarker} However , the , uh {disfmarker} e So that you understand , it is really simple . Uh {disfmarker} You {disfmarker} you have a route , and you cut it up in different pieces . And every {disfmarker} every element of that e r r f of that {disfmarker} Every segment we call a \" route element \" . And so , from A to B we cut up in three different steps , and every step has a \" from object \" where you start , a \" to object \" where y where {pause} you sort of end , and some points of interest along the way . What w I was sort of missing here , and uh , maybe it was just me being too stupid , is , {vocalsound} I didn't sort of get the {disfmarker} the notion of the global goal of the whole route . Really , s was not straightforward visibly for me . And some other stuff . And I {vocalsound} suggested that they should n be {disfmarker} k uh , kind enough to do s two things for us , is one , um , {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Also allocating , uh , some tags for our Action Schema Enter - Vista - Approach , and {disfmarker} And also , um , since you had suggested that {disfmarker} that , um , we figure out if we ever , for a demo reason , wanted to shortcut directly to the g GIS and the Planner , of how we can do it . Now , what 's the state of the art of getting to entrances , um , what 's the syntax for that , how get getting to {vocalsound} vista points and calculating those on the spot . And the Approach mode , anyhow , is the default . That 's all they do it these days . Wherever you 'll find a route planner it n does nothing but get to the closest point where the street network is {vocalsound} at minimal distance to the geometric center . </s> Professor B : Mm - hmm . </s> Grad C :  So . </s> Professor B : So , well , let {disfmarker} Now , this is important . Let , uh {disfmarker} I want a a Again , outside of m almost managerial point , um {disfmarker} You 're in the midst of this , so you know better . But it seems to me it 's probably a good idea to li uh {disfmarker} minimize the number of uh , change requests we make of them . So it seemed to me , what we ought to do is get our story together . OK ? And think about it some , internally , before asking them to make changes . </s> Grad C : Mm - hmm . </s> Professor B : Oh . Does this {disfmarker} does this make sense to you guys ? It {disfmarker} I mean you 're {disfmarker} you 're doing the {disfmarker} the interaction but it seemed to me that {vocalsound} what we ought to do is come up with a {disfmarker} uh , something where you , um {disfmarker} And I {disfmarker} I don't know who 's mok working most closely on it . Probably Johno . OK . Uh , take what they have , send it to everybody saying \" this is what they have , this is what we think we should add \" , OK ? and then have a d a {disfmarker} an iteration within our group saying \" Hmm , well {disfmarker} \" OK ? And get our best idea of what we should add . </s> Grad C : Mm - hmm . </s> Professor B : And then go back to them . Is i or , I don't know does this make sense to you ? Or </s> Grad C : Yeah . {vocalsound} Especially if we want {disfmarker} Sort of , what I {disfmarker} my feeling was eh we {disfmarker} we sort of reserved something that has a r eh an OK label . That 's {disfmarker} th that was my th first sort of step . </s> Professor B : Mm - hmm . </s> Grad C : I w No matter how we want to call it , {vocalsound} this is sort of our playground . </s> Professor B : Right . </s> Grad C : And if we get something in there that is a structure elaborate and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and complex enough to {disfmarker} to {disfmarker} to maybe enable a whole simulation , one of these days , that would be {disfmarker} u the {disfmarker} the perfect goal . </s> Professor B : Right . That 's right . So . So , Yeah . The problem isn't the short ra range optimization . It 's the sort of {disfmarker} o one or two year kind of thing . OK . What are the thl class of things we think we might try to do in a year or two ? How {disfmarker} how would we try to characterize those and what do we want to request now {vocalsound} that 's leave enough space to do all that stuff ? </s> Grad C : Mm - hmm . </s> Professor B : Right . </s> Grad C : Yep . </s> Professor B : And that re that requires some thought . </s> Grad C : Yep . </s> Professor B : And {disfmarker} so that sounds like a great thing to do {vocalsound} as the priority item um , as soon as we can do it . </s> Grad C : Yep .",

We have @ @ {comment} simple \" from objects \" and \" to objects \" and so forth , points of interest along the way {disfmarker} And , um , I asked them whether or not we could , um {disfmarker} First of all , I was little bit {disfmarker} It seemed to me that this m way of doing it is sort of a stack a step backwards from the way we 've done it before . t It seems to me that some notions were missing . </s> Professor B : S </s> Grad C : So these are {disfmarker} these are {disfmarker} </s> Professor B : So these are {disfmarker} these are your friends back at EML . </s> Grad C : Yep . Who are doing this . </s> Professor B : So this is not a complicated negotiation . There 's {disfmarker} there 's not seven committees , or anything , right ? </s> Grad C : No . No , this is very straightforward . </s> Professor B : Great . So this is just trying to {disfmarker} It 's a design thing , not a political thing . Once we 've {disfmarker} eh {disfmarker} We can just sort of agree on what oughta be done . </s> Grad C : Yeah . </s> Professor B : Good . </s> Grad C : Exactly . And , um {disfmarker} And , uh {disfmarker} However , the , uh {disfmarker} e So that you understand , it is really simple . Uh {disfmarker} You {disfmarker} you have a route , and you cut it up in different pieces . And every {disfmarker} every element of that e r r f of that {disfmarker} Every segment we call a \" route element \" . And so , from A to B we cut up in three different steps , and every step has a \" from object \" where you start , a \" to object \" where y where {pause} you sort of end , and some points of interest along the way . What w I was sort of missing here , and uh , maybe it was just me being too stupid , is , {vocalsound} I didn't sort of get the {disfmarker} the notion of the global goal of the whole route . Really , s was not straightforward visibly for me . And some other stuff . And I {vocalsound} suggested that they should n be {disfmarker} k uh , kind enough to do s two things for us , is one , um , {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Also allocating , uh , some tags for our Action Schema Enter - Vista - Approach , and {disfmarker} And also , um , since you had suggested that {disfmarker} that , um , we figure out if we ever , for a demo reason , wanted to shortcut directly to the g GIS and the Planner , of how we can do it . Now , what 's the state of the art of getting to entrances , um , what 's the syntax for that , how get getting to {vocalsound} vista points and calculating those on the spot . And the Approach mode , anyhow , is the default . That 's all they do it these days .

We have @ @ {comment} simple \" from objects \" and \" to objects \" and so forth , points of interest along the way {disfmarker} And , um , I asked them whether or not we could , um {disfmarker} First of all , I was little bit {disfmarker} It seemed to me that this m way of doing it is sort of a stack a step backwards from the way we 've done it before . t It seems to me that some notions were missing . </s> Professor B : S </s> Grad C : So these are {disfmarker} these are {disfmarker} </s> Professor B : So these are {disfmarker} these are your friends back at EML . </s> Grad C : Yep . Who are doing this . </s> Professor B : So this is not a complicated negotiation . There 's {disfmarker} there 's not seven committees , or anything , right ? </s> Grad C : No . No , this is very straightforward . </s> Professor B : Great . So this is just trying to {disfmarker} It 's a design thing , not a political thing . Once we 've {disfmarker} eh {disfmarker} We can just sort of agree on what oughta be done . </s> Grad C : Yeah . </s> Professor B : Good . </s> Grad C : Exactly . And , um {disfmarker} And , uh {disfmarker} However , the , uh {disfmarker} e So that you understand , it is really simple . Uh {disfmarker} You {disfmarker} you have a route , and you cut it up in different pieces . And every {disfmarker} every element of that e r r f of that {disfmarker} Every segment we call a \" route element \" . And so , from A to B we cut up in three different steps , and every step has a \" from object \" where you start , a \" to object \" where y where {pause} you sort of end , and some points of interest along the way . What w I was sort of missing here , and uh , maybe it was just me being too stupid , is , {vocalsound} I didn't sort of get the {disfmarker} the notion of the global goal of the whole route . Really , s was not straightforward visibly for me . And some other stuff . And I {vocalsound} suggested that they should n be {disfmarker} k uh , kind enough to do s two things for us , is one , um , {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Also allocating , uh , some tags for our Action Schema Enter - Vista - Approach , and {disfmarker} And also , um , since you had suggested that {disfmarker} that , um , we figure out if we ever , for a demo reason , wanted to shortcut directly to the g GIS and the Planner , of how we can do it . Now , what 's the state of the art of getting to entrances , um , what 's the syntax for that , how get getting to {vocalsound} vista points and calculating those on the spot . And the Approach mode , anyhow , is the default . That 's all they do it these days . Wherever you 'll find a route planner it n does nothing but get to the closest point where the street network is {vocalsound} at minimal distance to the geometric center . </s> Professor B : Mm - hmm . </s> Grad C :  So . </s> Professor B : So , well , let {disfmarker} Now , this is important . Let , uh {disfmarker} I want a a Again , outside of m almost managerial point , um {disfmarker} You 're in the midst of this , so you know better . But it seems to me it 's probably a good idea to li uh {disfmarker} minimize the number of uh , change requests we make of them . So it seemed to me , what we ought to do is get our story together . OK ? And think about it some , internally , before asking them to make changes . </s> Grad C : Mm - hmm . </s> Professor B : Oh . Does this {disfmarker} does this make sense to you guys ? It {disfmarker} I mean you 're {disfmarker} you 're doing the {disfmarker} the interaction but it seemed to me that {vocalsound} what we ought to do is come up with a {disfmarker} uh , something where you , um {disfmarker} And I {disfmarker} I don't know who 's mok working most closely on it . Probably Johno . OK . Uh , take what they have , send it to everybody saying \" this is what they have , this is what we think we should add \" , OK ? and then have a d a {disfmarker} an iteration within our group saying \" Hmm , well {disfmarker} \" OK ?

What are the thl class of things we think we might try to do in a year or two ?

Th - now you get to tell us what 's the interesting part . </s> PhD E : Please specify . </s> Professor G : But {disfmarker} </s> PhD B : Well , uh , I guess the work that 's been {pause} done on segmentation would be most {disfmarker} </s> PhD C : Yeah . </s> Postdoc F : I think that would be a good thing to start with . </s> PhD B : Yeah . </s> Professor G : OK . Um , and , um , {vocalsound} the other thing , uh , which I 'll just say very briefly that maybe relates to that a little bit , which is that , um , uh , one of the suggestions that came up in a brief meeting I had the other day when I was in Spain with , uh , Manolo Pardo and {vocalsound} Javier , uh , Ferreiros , who was {pause} here before , was , um , why not start with what they had before but add in the non - silence boundaries . So , in what Javier did before when they were doing , um {disfmarker} h he was looking for , uh , speaker change {pause} points . </s> PhD D : Mm - hmm . </s> Professor G : Um . As a simplification , he originally did this only using {pause} silence as , uh , a {pause} putative , uh , speaker change point . </s> PhD C : Yeah . </s> Professor G : And , uh , he did not , say , look at points where you were changing broad sp uh , phonetic class , for instance . And for Broadcast News , that was fine . Here obviously it 's not . </s> PhD D : Yeah . </s> Professor G : And , um , so one of the things that they were pushing in d in discussing with me is , um , w why are you spending so much time , uh , on the , uh , feature issue , uh , when perhaps if you sort of deal with what you were using before </s> PhD D : Uh - huh . </s> Professor G : and then just broadened it a bit , instead of just ta using silence as putative change point also {disfmarker} ? </s> PhD D : Nnn , yeah . </s> Professor G : So then you 've got {disfmarker} you already have the super - structure with Gaussians and H - you know , simple H M Ms and so forth . And you {disfmarker} you might {disfmarker} So there was a {disfmarker} there was a little bit of a {disfmarker} a {disfmarker} a {disfmarker} a difference of opinion because I {disfmarker} I thought that it was {disfmarker} it 's interesting to look at what features are useful . </s> PhD D : Yeah . </s> Professor G : But , uh , on the other hand I saw that the {disfmarker} they had a good point that , uh , if we had something that worked for many cases before , maybe starting from there a little bit {disfmarker} Because ultimately we 're gonna end up {vocalsound} with some s su kind of structure like that , </s> PhD D : Yeah . </s> Professor G : where you have some kind of simple HMM and you 're testing the hypothesis that , {vocalsound} uh , there is a change . </s> PhD D : Yeah . </s> Professor G : So {disfmarker} so anyway , I just {disfmarker} reporting that . </s> PhD D : OK . </s> Professor G : But , uh , uh {disfmarker} So . Yeah , why don't we do the speech - nonspeech discussion ? </s> Postdoc F : Yeah . Do {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I hear {disfmarker} you {disfmarker} you didn't {disfmarker} </s> PhD C : Speech - nonspeech ? OK . </s> Postdoc F : Uh - huh . Yeah . </s> PhD C : Um , so , uh , what we basically did so far was using the mixed file to {disfmarker} to detect s speech or nonspeech {pause} portions in that . </s> Professor G : Mm - hmm . </s> PhD C : And what I did so far is I just used our old Munich system , which is an HMM - ba based system with Gaussian mixtures for s speech and nonspeech . And it was a system which used only one Gaussian for silence and one Gaussian for speech . And now I added , uh , multi - mixture possibility for {disfmarker} {vocalsound} for speech and nonspeech . </s> Professor G : Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . </s> PhD C : And I did some training on {disfmarker} on one dialogue , which was transcribed by {disfmarker} Yeah . We {disfmarker} we did a nons s speech - nonspeech transcription . </s> PhD D : Jose . </s> PhD C : Adam , Dave , and I , we did , for that dialogue and I trained it on that . And I did some pre - segmentations for {disfmarker} for Jane . And I 'm not sure how good they are or what {disfmarker} what the transcribers say . They {disfmarker} they can use it or {disfmarker} ? </s> Postdoc F : Uh , they {disfmarker} they think it 's a terrific improvement . And , um , it real it just makes a {disfmarker} a world of difference . </s> Professor G : Hmm . </s> Postdoc F : And , um , y you also did some something in addition which was , um , for those in which there {nonvocalsound} was , uh , quiet speakers in the mix . </s> PhD C : Yeah . Uh , yeah . That {disfmarker} that was one {disfmarker} one {disfmarker} one thing , uh , why I added more mixtures for {disfmarker} for the speech . So I saw that there were loud {disfmarker} loudly speaking speakers and quietly speaking speakers . </s> Professor G : Mm - hmm . </s> PhD C : And so I did two mixtures , one for the loud speakers and one for the quiet speakers . </s> Grad A : And did you hand - label who was loud and who was quiet , or did you just {disfmarker} ? </s> PhD C : I did that for {disfmarker} for five minutes of one dialogue </s> Grad A : Right . </s> PhD C : and that was enough to {disfmarker} to train the system . </s> PhD B : W What {disfmarker} ? </s> PhD D : Yeah . </s> PhD C : And so it {disfmarker} it adapts , uh , on {disfmarker} while running . So . </s> PhD B : What kind of , uh , front - end processing did you do ? </s> PhD C : Hopefully . </s> PhD D : OK . </s> PhD C : It 's just our {disfmarker} our old Munich , uh , loudness - based spectrum on mel scale twenty {disfmarker} twenty critical bands and then loudness . </s> PhD B : Mm - hmm . </s> PhD C : And four additional features , which is energy , loudness , modified loudness , and zero crossing rate . So it 's twenty - four {disfmarker} twenty - four features . </s> PhD B : Mmm . </s> Professor G : Mm - hmm . </s> Postdoc F : And you also provided me with several different versions , </s> PhD C : Yeah . </s> Postdoc F : which I compared . </s> PhD C : Yeah . </s> Postdoc F : And so you change {nonvocalsound} parameters . What {disfmarker} do you wanna say something about the parameters {nonvocalsound} that you change ? </s> PhD C : Yeah . You can specify {vocalsound} the minimum length of speech or {disfmarker} and silence portions which you want . And so I did some {disfmarker} some modifications in those parameters , basically changing the minimum {disfmarker} minimum {pause} length for s for silence to have , er to have , um {disfmarker} yeah {disfmarker} to have more or less , uh , silence portions in inserted . So . </s> Grad A : Right . So this would work well for , uh , pauses and utterance boundaries and things like that . </s> PhD D : Yeah . </s> PhD C : Yeah . Yeah . </s> Grad A : But for overlap I imagine that doesn't work at all , </s> PhD C : Yeah . </s> PhD D : Yeah . </s> Grad A : that you 'll have plenty of s sections that are {disfmarker} </s> PhD C : Yeah . </s> PhD D : Yeah . </s> PhD C : That 's it . Yeah . </s> Postdoc F : Mm - hmm , mm - hmm . </s> PhD D : Yeah . </s> Grad A : But {disfmarker} </s> Postdoc F : That 's true . But {nonvocalsound} it {disfmarker} it saves so much time {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the {nonvocalsound} transcribers </s> Professor G : Um {disfmarker} </s> Grad A : Yep . </s> Postdoc F : just enormous , enormous savings . Fantastic . </s> Professor G : That 's great . Um , just qu one quickly , uh , still on the features . So {vocalsound} you have these twenty - four features . </s> PhD C : Yeah . </s> Professor G : Uh , a lot of them are spectral features . Is there a {disfmarker} a transformation , uh , like principal components transformation or something ? </s> PhD C : No . </s> Grad A : Yeah . It was IS two . </s> PhD C : No . W w we {disfmarker} originally we did that </s> Professor G : Just {disfmarker} </s> PhD C : but we saw , uh , when we used it , uh , f for our close - talking microphone , which {disfmarker} yeah , for our {disfmarker} for our recognizer in Munich {disfmarker} we saw that w it 's {disfmarker} it 's not {disfmarker} it 's not so necessary . It {disfmarker} it works as well f with {disfmarker} with {disfmarker} without , uh , a LDA or something . </s> Professor G : OK . OK . No , I was j {pause} curious . </s> PhD C : Yeah . </s> Postdoc F : Mm - hmm . </s> Professor G : Yeah , I don't think it 's a big deal for this application , </s> PhD C : Yeah . </s> PhD D : Right . </s> Professor G : but {disfmarker} but {disfmarker} Yeah , it 's a {disfmarker} </s> Postdoc F : Mm - hmm . OK . But then there 's another thing that also Thilo 's involved with , which is , um {disfmarker} OK , and {disfmarker} and also Da - Dave Gelbart . So there 's this {disfmarker} this problem of {disfmarker} and w and {disfmarker} so we had this meeting . Th - the {nonvocalsound} {disfmarker} also Adam , before the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} before you went away . Uh we , um {disfmarker} regarding the representation {nonvocalsound} of overlaps , because at present , {nonvocalsound} {vocalsound} um , because {nonvocalsound} of the limitations of {vocalsound} th the interface we 're using , overlaps are , uh , not being {nonvocalsound} encoded by {nonvocalsound} the transcribers in as complete {nonvocalsound} and , uh , detailed a way as it might be , and as might be desired {disfmarker} I think would be desired in the corpus ultimately . </s> Professor G : Mm - hmm . </s> Postdoc F : So we don't have start and end points {nonvocalsound} at each point where there 's an overlap . We just have the {disfmarker} the {nonvocalsound} overlaps {nonvocalsound} encoded in a simple bin . Well , OK . So {nonvocalsound} @ @ the limits of the {nonvocalsound} over of {disfmarker} of the interface are {vocalsound} such that we were {disfmarker} at this meeting we were entertaining how we might either expand {nonvocalsound} the {disfmarker} the {vocalsound} interface or find other tools which already {pause} do what would be useful . Because what would ultimately be , um , ideal in my {disfmarker} my view and I think {disfmarker} I mean , I had the sense that it was consensus , is that , um , a thorough - going musical score notation would be {nonvocalsound} the best way to go . Because {nonvocalsound} you can have multiple channels , there 's a single time - line , it 's very clear , flexible , and all those nice things . </s> Professor G : Mm - hmm . </s> Postdoc F : OK . So , um , um , I spoke {disfmarker} I had a meeting with Dave Gelbart on {disfmarker} on {disfmarker} and he had , uh , excellent ideas on how {pause} the interface could be {pause} modified to {disfmarker} to do this kind of representation . But , um , he {disfmarker} in the meantime you were checking into the existence of already , um , existing interfaces which might already have these properties . So , do you wanna say something about that ? </s> PhD C : Yes . Um , I {vocalsound} talked with , uh , Munich guys from {disfmarker} from Ludwi - Ludwig Maximilians University , who do a lot of transcribing and transliterations . </s> Professor G : Mm - hmm . </s> PhD C : And they basically said they have {disfmarker} they have , uh , a tool they developed {pause} themselves and they can't give away , uh , f it 's too error - prone , and had {disfmarker} it 's not supported , a a a and {disfmarker} </s> Professor G : Yeah . </s> PhD C : But , um , Susanne Bur - Burger , who is at se CMU , he wa who was formally at {disfmarker} in Munich and w and is now at {disfmarker} with CMU , she said she has something which she uses to do eight channels , uh , trans transliterations , eight channels simultaneously , </s> Professor G : Excuse me . </s> PhD C : but it 's running under Windows . </s> Postdoc F : Under Windows . </s> PhD C : So I 'm not sure if {disfmarker} if {disfmarker} if we can use it . </s> Postdoc F : Mm - hmm . </s> PhD C : She said she would give it to us . </s> Postdoc F : Mm - hmm . </s> PhD C : It wouldn't be a problem . And I 've got some {disfmarker} some kind of manual {pause} down in my office . </s> Grad A : Well , maybe we should get it and if it 's good enough we 'll arrange Windows machines to be available .",

So {nonvocalsound} @ @ the limits of the {nonvocalsound} over of {disfmarker} of the interface are {vocalsound} such that we were {disfmarker} at this meeting we were entertaining how we might either expand {nonvocalsound} the {disfmarker} the {vocalsound} interface or find other tools which already {pause} do what would be useful .

Yeah . </s> PhD C : Um , so , uh , what we basically did so far was using the mixed file to {disfmarker} to detect s speech or nonspeech {pause} portions in that . </s> Professor G : Mm - hmm . </s> PhD C : And what I did so far is I just used our old Munich system , which is an HMM - ba based system with Gaussian mixtures for s speech and nonspeech .

We {disfmarker} we did a nons s speech - nonspeech transcription . </s> PhD D : Jose . </s> PhD C : Adam , Dave , and I , we did , for that dialogue and I trained it on that .

Uh , yeah . That {disfmarker} that was one {disfmarker} one {disfmarker} one thing , uh , why I added more mixtures for {disfmarker} for the speech . So I saw that there were loud {disfmarker} loudly speaking speakers and quietly speaking speakers . </s> Professor G : Mm - hmm . </s> PhD C : And so I did two mixtures , one for the loud speakers and one for the quiet speakers . </s> Grad A : And did you hand - label who was loud and who was quiet , or did you just {disfmarker} ? </s> PhD C : I did that for {disfmarker} for five minutes of one dialogue </s> Grad A : Right . </s> PhD C : and that was enough to {disfmarker} to train the system . </s> PhD B : W What {disfmarker} ? </s> PhD D : Yeah . </s> PhD C : And so it {disfmarker} it adapts , uh , on {disfmarker} while running . So . </s> PhD B : What kind of , uh , front - end processing did you do ? </s> PhD C : Hopefully . </s> PhD D : OK . </s> PhD C : It 's just our {disfmarker} our old Munich , uh , loudness - based spectrum on mel scale twenty {disfmarker} twenty critical bands and then loudness . </s> PhD B : Mm - hmm . </s> PhD C : And four additional features , which is energy , loudness , modified loudness , and zero crossing rate . So it 's twenty - four {disfmarker} twenty - four features . </s> PhD B : Mmm . </s> Professor G : Mm - hmm . </s> Postdoc F : And you also provided me with several different versions , </s> PhD C : Yeah . </s> Postdoc F : which I compared . </s> PhD C : Yeah . </s> Postdoc F : And so you change {nonvocalsound} parameters . What {disfmarker} do you wanna say something about the parameters {nonvocalsound} that you change ? </s> PhD C : Yeah . You can specify {vocalsound} the minimum length of speech or {disfmarker} and silence portions which you want . And so I did some {disfmarker} some modifications in those parameters , basically changing the minimum {disfmarker} minimum {pause} length for s for silence to have , er to have , um {disfmarker} yeah {disfmarker} to have more or less , uh , silence portions in inserted . So . </s> Grad A : Right . So this would work well for , uh , pauses and utterance boundaries and things like that . </s> PhD D : Yeah . </s> PhD C : Yeah . Yeah . </s> Grad A : But for overlap I imagine that doesn't work at all , </s> PhD C : Yeah . </s> PhD D : Yeah . </s> Grad A : that you 'll have plenty of s sections that are {disfmarker} </s> PhD C : Yeah . </s> PhD D : Yeah . </s> PhD C : That 's it . Yeah . </s> Postdoc F : Mm - hmm , mm - hmm . </s> PhD D : Yeah . </s> Grad A : But {disfmarker} </s> Postdoc F : That 's true . But {nonvocalsound} it {disfmarker} it saves so much time {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the {nonvocalsound} transcribers </s> Professor G : Um {disfmarker} </s> Grad A : Yep . </s> Postdoc F : just enormous , enormous savings . Fantastic . </s> Professor G : That 's great . Um , just qu one quickly , uh , still on the features . So {vocalsound} you have these twenty - four features . </s> PhD C : Yeah . </s> Professor G : Uh , a lot of them are spectral features . Is there a {disfmarker} a transformation , uh , like principal components transformation or something ? </s> PhD C : No . </s> Grad A : Yeah . It was IS two . </s> PhD C : No . W w we {disfmarker} originally we did that </s> Professor G : Just {disfmarker} </s> PhD C : but we saw , uh , when we used it , uh , f for our close - talking microphone , which {disfmarker} yeah , for our {disfmarker} for our recognizer in Munich {disfmarker} we saw that w it 's {disfmarker} it 's not {disfmarker} it 's not so necessary . It {disfmarker} it works as well f with {disfmarker} with {disfmarker} without , uh , a LDA or something . </s> Professor G : OK . OK . No , I was j {pause} curious . </s> PhD C : Yeah . </s> Postdoc F : Mm - hmm . </s> Professor G : Yeah , I don't think it 's a big deal for this application , </s> PhD C : Yeah . </s> PhD D : Right . </s> Professor G : but {disfmarker} but {disfmarker} Yeah , it 's a {disfmarker} </s> Postdoc F : Mm - hmm .

You can specify {vocalsound} the minimum length of speech or {disfmarker} and silence portions which you want .

As a simplification , he originally did this only using {pause} silence as , uh , a {pause} putative , uh , speaker change point . </s> PhD C : Yeah . </s> Professor G : And , uh , he did not , say , look at points where you were changing broad sp uh , phonetic class , for instance . And for Broadcast News , that was fine . Here obviously it 's not . </s> PhD D : Yeah . </s> Professor G : And , um , so one of the things that they were pushing in d in discussing with me is , um , w why are you spending so much time , uh , on the , uh , feature issue , uh , when perhaps if you sort of deal with what you were using before </s> PhD D : Uh - huh . </s> Professor G : and then just broadened it a bit , instead of just ta using silence as putative change point also {disfmarker} ? </s> PhD D : Nnn , yeah . </s> Professor G : So then you 've got {disfmarker} you already have the super - structure with Gaussians and H - you know , simple H M Ms and so forth .

Th - now you get to tell us what 's the interesting part . </s> PhD E : Please specify . </s> Professor G : But {disfmarker} </s> PhD B : Well , uh , I guess the work that 's been {pause} done on segmentation would be most {disfmarker} </s> PhD C : Yeah . </s> Postdoc F : I think that would be a good thing to start with . </s> PhD B : Yeah . </s> Professor G : OK . Um , and , um , {vocalsound} the other thing , uh , which I 'll just say very briefly that maybe relates to that a little bit , which is that , um , uh , one of the suggestions that came up in a brief meeting I had the other day when I was in Spain with , uh , Manolo Pardo and {vocalsound} Javier , uh , Ferreiros , who was {pause} here before , was , um , why not start with what they had before but add in the non - silence boundaries . So , in what Javier did before when they were doing , um {disfmarker} h he was looking for , uh , speaker change {pause} points . </s> PhD D : Mm - hmm . </s> Professor G : Um . As a simplification , he originally did this only using {pause} silence as , uh , a {pause} putative , uh , speaker change point . </s> PhD C : Yeah . </s> Professor G : And , uh , he did not , say , look at points where you were changing broad sp uh , phonetic class , for instance . And for Broadcast News , that was fine . Here obviously it 's not . </s> PhD D : Yeah . </s> Professor G : And , um , so one of the things that they were pushing in d in discussing with me is , um , w why are you spending so much time , uh , on the , uh , feature issue , uh , when perhaps if you sort of deal with what you were using before </s> PhD D : Uh - huh . </s> Professor G : and then just broadened it a bit , instead of just ta using silence as putative change point also {disfmarker} ? </s> PhD D : Nnn , yeah . </s> Professor G : So then you 've got {disfmarker} you already have the super - structure with Gaussians and H - you know , simple H M Ms and so forth . And you {disfmarker} you might {disfmarker} So there was a {disfmarker} there was a little bit of a {disfmarker} a {disfmarker} a {disfmarker} a difference of opinion because I {disfmarker} I thought that it was {disfmarker} it 's interesting to look at what features are useful . </s> PhD D : Yeah . </s> Professor G : But , uh , on the other hand I saw that the {disfmarker} they had a good point that , uh , if we had something that worked for many cases before , maybe starting from there a little bit {disfmarker} Because ultimately we 're gonna end up {vocalsound} with some s su kind of structure like that , </s> PhD D : Yeah . </s> Professor G : where you have some kind of simple HMM and you 're testing the hypothesis that , {vocalsound} uh , there is a change . </s> PhD D : Yeah . </s> Professor G : So {disfmarker} so anyway , I just {disfmarker} reporting that . </s> PhD D : OK . </s> Professor G : But , uh , uh {disfmarker} So . Yeah , why don't we do the speech - nonspeech discussion ? </s> Postdoc F : Yeah . Do {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I hear {disfmarker} you {disfmarker} you didn't {disfmarker} </s> PhD C : Speech - nonspeech ? OK . </s> Postdoc F : Uh - huh . Yeah . </s> PhD C : Um , so , uh , what we basically did so far was using the mixed file to {disfmarker} to detect s speech or nonspeech {pause} portions in that . </s> Professor G : Mm - hmm . </s> PhD C : And what I did so far is I just used our old Munich system , which is an HMM - ba based system with Gaussian mixtures for s speech and nonspeech . And it was a system which used only one Gaussian for silence and one Gaussian for speech . And now I added , uh , multi - mixture possibility for {disfmarker} {vocalsound} for speech and nonspeech . </s> Professor G : Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . </s> PhD C : And I did some training on {disfmarker} on one dialogue , which was transcribed by {disfmarker} Yeah . We {disfmarker} we did a nons s speech - nonspeech transcription . </s> PhD D : Jose . </s> PhD C : Adam , Dave , and I , we did , for that dialogue and I trained it on that . And I did some pre - segmentations for {disfmarker} for Jane . And I 'm not sure how good they are or what {disfmarker} what the transcribers say . They {disfmarker} they can use it or {disfmarker} ? </s> Postdoc F : Uh , they {disfmarker} they think it 's a terrific improvement . And , um , it real it just makes a {disfmarker} a world of difference . </s> Professor G : Hmm . </s> Postdoc F : And , um , y you also did some something in addition which was , um , for those in which there {nonvocalsound} was , uh , quiet speakers in the mix . </s> PhD C : Yeah . Uh , yeah . That {disfmarker} that was one {disfmarker} one {disfmarker} one thing , uh , why I added more mixtures for {disfmarker} for the speech . So I saw that there were loud {disfmarker} loudly speaking speakers and quietly speaking speakers . </s> Professor G : Mm - hmm . </s> PhD C : And so I did two mixtures , one for the loud speakers and one for the quiet speakers . </s> Grad A : And did you hand - label who was loud and who was quiet , or did you just {disfmarker} ? </s> PhD C : I did that for {disfmarker} for five minutes of one dialogue </s> Grad A : Right . </s> PhD C : and that was enough to {disfmarker} to train the system . </s> PhD B : W What {disfmarker} ? </s> PhD D : Yeah . </s> PhD C : And so it {disfmarker} it adapts , uh , on {disfmarker} while running . So . </s> PhD B : What kind of , uh , front - end processing did you do ? </s> PhD C : Hopefully . </s> PhD D : OK . </s> PhD C : It 's just our {disfmarker} our old Munich , uh , loudness - based spectrum on mel scale twenty {disfmarker} twenty critical bands and then loudness . </s> PhD B : Mm - hmm . </s> PhD C : And four additional features , which is energy , loudness , modified loudness , and zero crossing rate . So it 's twenty - four {disfmarker} twenty - four features . </s> PhD B : Mmm . </s> Professor G : Mm - hmm . </s> Postdoc F : And you also provided me with several different versions , </s> PhD C : Yeah . </s> Postdoc F : which I compared . </s> PhD C : Yeah . </s> Postdoc F : And so you change {nonvocalsound} parameters . What {disfmarker} do you wanna say something about the parameters {nonvocalsound} that you change ? </s> PhD C : Yeah . You can specify {vocalsound} the minimum length of speech or {disfmarker} and silence portions which you want . And so I did some {disfmarker} some modifications in those parameters , basically changing the minimum {disfmarker} minimum {pause} length for s for silence to have , er to have , um {disfmarker} yeah {disfmarker} to have more or less , uh , silence portions in inserted . So . </s> Grad A : Right . So this would work well for , uh , pauses and utterance boundaries and things like that . </s> PhD D : Yeah . </s> PhD C : Yeah . Yeah . </s> Grad A : But for overlap I imagine that doesn't work at all , </s> PhD C : Yeah . </s> PhD D : Yeah . </s> Grad A : that you 'll have plenty of s sections that are {disfmarker} </s> PhD C : Yeah . </s> PhD D : Yeah . </s> PhD C : That 's it . Yeah . </s> Postdoc F : Mm - hmm , mm - hmm . </s> PhD D : Yeah . </s> Grad A : But {disfmarker} </s> Postdoc F : That 's true . But {nonvocalsound} it {disfmarker} it saves so much time {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the {nonvocalsound} transcribers </s> Professor G : Um {disfmarker} </s> Grad A : Yep . </s> Postdoc F : just enormous , enormous savings . Fantastic . </s> Professor G : That 's great . Um , just qu one quickly , uh , still on the features . So {vocalsound} you have these twenty - four features . </s> PhD C : Yeah . </s> Professor G : Uh , a lot of them are spectral features . Is there a {disfmarker} a transformation , uh , like principal components transformation or something ? </s> PhD C : No . </s> Grad A : Yeah . It was IS two . </s> PhD C : No . W w we {disfmarker} originally we did that </s> Professor G : Just {disfmarker} </s> PhD C : but we saw , uh , when we used it , uh , f for our close - talking microphone , which {disfmarker} yeah , for our {disfmarker} for our recognizer in Munich {disfmarker} we saw that w it 's {disfmarker} it 's not {disfmarker} it 's not so necessary . It {disfmarker} it works as well f with {disfmarker} with {disfmarker} without , uh , a LDA or something . </s> Professor G : OK . OK . No , I was j {pause} curious . </s> PhD C : Yeah . </s> Postdoc F : Mm - hmm . </s> Professor G : Yeah , I don't think it 's a big deal for this application , </s> PhD C : Yeah . </s> PhD D : Right . </s> Professor G : but {disfmarker} but {disfmarker} Yeah , it 's a {disfmarker} </s> Postdoc F : Mm - hmm . OK . But then there 's another thing that also Thilo 's involved with , which is , um {disfmarker} OK , and {disfmarker} and also Da - Dave Gelbart . So there 's this {disfmarker} this problem of {disfmarker} and w and {disfmarker} so we had this meeting . Th - the {nonvocalsound} {disfmarker} also Adam , before the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} before you went away . Uh we , um {disfmarker} regarding the representation {nonvocalsound} of overlaps , because at present , {nonvocalsound} {vocalsound} um , because {nonvocalsound} of the limitations of {vocalsound} th the interface we 're using , overlaps are , uh , not being {nonvocalsound} encoded by {nonvocalsound} the transcribers in as complete {nonvocalsound} and , uh , detailed a way as it might be , and as might be desired {disfmarker} I think would be desired in the corpus ultimately . </s> Professor G : Mm - hmm . </s> Postdoc F : So we don't have start and end points {nonvocalsound} at each point where there 's an overlap . We just have the {disfmarker} the {nonvocalsound} overlaps {nonvocalsound} encoded in a simple bin . Well , OK . So {nonvocalsound} @ @ the limits of the {nonvocalsound} over of {disfmarker} of the interface are {vocalsound} such that we were {disfmarker} at this meeting we were entertaining how we might either expand {nonvocalsound} the {disfmarker} the {vocalsound} interface or find other tools which already {pause} do what would be useful . Because what would ultimately be , um , ideal in my {disfmarker} my view and I think {disfmarker} I mean , I had the sense that it was consensus , is that , um , a thorough - going musical score notation would be {nonvocalsound} the best way to go . Because {nonvocalsound} you can have multiple channels , there 's a single time - line , it 's very clear , flexible , and all those nice things . </s> Professor G : Mm - hmm . </s> Postdoc F : OK . So , um , um , I spoke {disfmarker} I had a meeting with Dave Gelbart on {disfmarker} on {disfmarker} and he had , uh , excellent ideas on how {pause} the interface could be {pause} modified to {disfmarker} to do this kind of representation . But , um , he {disfmarker} in the meantime you were checking into the existence of already , um , existing interfaces which might already have these properties . So , do you wanna say something about that ? </s> PhD C : Yes . Um , I {vocalsound} talked with , uh , Munich guys from {disfmarker} from Ludwi - Ludwig Maximilians University , who do a lot of transcribing and transliterations . </s> Professor G : Mm - hmm . </s> PhD C : And they basically said they have {disfmarker} they have , uh , a tool they developed {pause} themselves and they can't give away , uh , f it 's too error - prone , and had {disfmarker} it 's not supported , a a a and {disfmarker} </s> Professor G : Yeah . </s> PhD C : But , um , Susanne Bur - Burger , who is at se CMU , he wa who was formally at {disfmarker} in Munich and w and is now at {disfmarker} with CMU , she said she has something which she uses to do eight channels , uh , trans transliterations , eight channels simultaneously , </s> Professor G : Excuse me . </s> PhD C : but it 's running under Windows . </s> Postdoc F : Under Windows . </s> PhD C : So I 'm not sure if {disfmarker} if {disfmarker} if we can use it . </s> Postdoc F : Mm - hmm . </s> PhD C : She said she would give it to us . </s> Postdoc F : Mm - hmm . </s> PhD C : It wouldn't be a problem . And I 've got some {disfmarker} some kind of manual {pause} down in my office . </s> Grad A : Well , maybe we should get it and if it 's good enough we 'll arrange Windows machines to be available .",

Uh , yeah . That {disfmarker} that was one {disfmarker} one {disfmarker} one thing , uh , why I added more mixtures for {disfmarker} for the speech . So I saw that there were loud {disfmarker} loudly speaking speakers and quietly speaking speakers . </s> Professor G : Mm - hmm . </s> PhD C : And so I did two mixtures , one for the loud speakers and one for the quiet speakers . </s> Grad A : And did you hand - label who was loud and who was quiet , or did you just {disfmarker} ? </s> PhD C : I did that for {disfmarker} for five minutes of one dialogue </s> Grad A : Right . </s> PhD C : and that was enough to {disfmarker} to train the system . </s> PhD B : W What {disfmarker} ? </s> PhD D : Yeah . </s> PhD C : And so it {disfmarker} it adapts , uh , on {disfmarker} while running . So . </s> PhD B : What kind of , uh , front - end processing did you do ? </s> PhD C : Hopefully . </s> PhD D : OK . </s> PhD C : It 's just our {disfmarker} our old Munich , uh , loudness - based spectrum on mel scale twenty {disfmarker} twenty critical bands and then loudness . </s> PhD B : Mm - hmm . </s> PhD C : And four additional features , which is energy , loudness , modified loudness , and zero crossing rate .

What {disfmarker} do you wanna say something about the parameters {nonvocalsound} that you change ? </s> PhD C : Yeah . You can specify {vocalsound} the minimum length of speech or {disfmarker} and silence portions which you want . And so I did some {disfmarker} some modifications in those parameters , basically changing the minimum {disfmarker} minimum {pause} length for s for silence to have , er to have , um {disfmarker} yeah {disfmarker} to have more or less , uh , silence portions in inserted . So . </s> Grad A : Right . So this would work well for , uh , pauses and utterance boundaries and things like that . </s> PhD D : Yeah . </s> PhD C : Yeah . Yeah . </s> Grad A : But for overlap I imagine that doesn't work at all , </s> PhD C : Yeah . </s> PhD D : Yeah . </s> Grad A : that you 'll have plenty of s sections that are {disfmarker} </s> PhD C : Yeah . </s> PhD D : Yeah . </s> PhD C : That 's it . Yeah . </s> Postdoc F : Mm - hmm , mm - hmm . </s> PhD D : Yeah . </s> Grad A : But {disfmarker} </s> Postdoc F : That 's true . But {nonvocalsound} it {disfmarker} it saves so much time {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the {nonvocalsound} transcribers </s> Professor G : Um {disfmarker} </s> Grad A : Yep . </s> Postdoc F : just enormous , enormous savings . Fantastic . </s> Professor G : That 's great . Um , just qu one quickly , uh , still on the features . So {vocalsound} you have these twenty - four features . </s> PhD C : Yeah . </s> Professor G : Uh , a lot of them are spectral features . Is there a {disfmarker} a transformation , uh , like principal components transformation or something ? </s> PhD C : No . </s> Grad A : Yeah . It was IS two . </s> PhD C : No . W w we {disfmarker} originally we did that </s> Professor G : Just {disfmarker} </s> PhD C : but we saw , uh , when we used it , uh , f for our close - talking microphone , which {disfmarker} yeah , for our {disfmarker} for our recognizer in Munich {disfmarker} we saw that w it 's {disfmarker} it 's not {disfmarker} it 's not so necessary . It {disfmarker} it works as well f with {disfmarker} with {disfmarker} without , uh , a LDA or something . </s> Professor G : OK . OK . No , I was j {pause} curious . </s> PhD C : Yeah . </s> Postdoc F : Mm - hmm . </s> Professor G : Yeah , I don't think it 's a big deal for this application , </s> PhD C : Yeah . </s> PhD D : Right . </s> Professor G : but {disfmarker} but {disfmarker} Yeah , it 's a {disfmarker} </s> Postdoc F : Mm - hmm . OK . But then there 's another thing that also Thilo 's involved with , which is , um {disfmarker} OK , and {disfmarker} and also Da - Dave Gelbart . So there 's this {disfmarker} this problem of {disfmarker} and w and {disfmarker} so we had this meeting . Th - the {nonvocalsound} {disfmarker} also Adam , before the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} before you went away . Uh we , um {disfmarker} regarding the representation {nonvocalsound} of overlaps , because at present , {nonvocalsound} {vocalsound} um , because {nonvocalsound} of the limitations of {vocalsound} th the interface we 're using , overlaps are , uh , not being {nonvocalsound} encoded by {nonvocalsound} the transcribers in as complete {nonvocalsound} and , uh , detailed a way as it might be , and as might be desired {disfmarker} I think would be desired in the corpus ultimately . </s> Professor G : Mm - hmm . </s> Postdoc F : So we don't have start and end points {nonvocalsound} at each point where there 's an overlap . We just have the {disfmarker} the {nonvocalsound} overlaps {nonvocalsound} encoded in a simple bin . Well , OK . So {nonvocalsound} @ @ the limits of the {nonvocalsound} over of {disfmarker} of the interface are {vocalsound} such that we were {disfmarker} at this meeting we were entertaining how we might either expand {nonvocalsound} the {disfmarker} the {vocalsound} interface or find other tools which already {pause} do what would be useful . Because what would ultimately be , um , ideal in my {disfmarker} my view and I think {disfmarker} I mean , I had the sense that it was consensus , is that , um , a thorough - going musical score notation would be {nonvocalsound} the best way to go .

Yeah . </s> Grad A : But for overlap I imagine that doesn't work at all , </s> PhD C : Yeah . </s> PhD D : Yeah . </s> Grad A : that you 'll have plenty of s sections that are {disfmarker} </s> PhD C : Yeah . </s> PhD D : Yeah . </s> PhD C : That 's it .

OK . But then there 's another thing that also Thilo 's involved with , which is , um {disfmarker} OK , and {disfmarker} and also Da - Dave Gelbart . So there 's this {disfmarker} this problem of {disfmarker} and w and {disfmarker} so we had this meeting .

We just have the {disfmarker} the {nonvocalsound} overlaps {nonvocalsound} encoded in a simple bin . Well , OK . So {nonvocalsound} @ @ the limits of the {nonvocalsound} over of {disfmarker} of the interface are {vocalsound} such that we were {disfmarker} at this meeting we were entertaining how we might either expand {nonvocalsound} the {disfmarker} the {vocalsound} interface or find other tools which already {pause} do what would be useful . Because what would ultimately be , um , ideal in my {disfmarker} my view and I think {disfmarker} I mean , I had the sense that it was consensus , is that , um , a thorough - going musical score notation would be {nonvocalsound} the best way to go . Because {nonvocalsound} you can have multiple channels , there 's a single time - line , it 's very clear , flexible , and all those nice things . </s> Professor G : Mm - hmm . </s> Postdoc F : OK . So , um , um , I spoke {disfmarker} I had a meeting with Dave Gelbart on {disfmarker} on {disfmarker} and he had , uh , excellent ideas on how {pause} the interface could be {pause} modified to {disfmarker} to do this kind of representation . But , um , he {disfmarker} in the meantime you were checking into the existence of already , um , existing interfaces which might already have these properties . So , do you wanna say something about that ? </s> PhD C : Yes . Um , I {vocalsound} talked with , uh , Munich guys from {disfmarker} from Ludwi - Ludwig Maximilians University , who do a lot of transcribing and transliterations . </s> Professor G : Mm - hmm . </s> PhD C : And they basically said they have {disfmarker} they have , uh , a tool they developed {pause} themselves and they can't give away , uh , f it 's too error - prone , and had {disfmarker} it 's not supported , a a a and {disfmarker} </s> Professor G : Yeah . </s> PhD C : But , um , Susanne Bur - Burger , who is at se CMU , he wa who was formally at {disfmarker} in Munich and w and is now at {disfmarker} with CMU , she said she has something which she uses to do eight channels , uh , trans transliterations , eight channels simultaneously , </s> Professor G : Excuse me . </s> PhD C : but it 's running under Windows . </s> Postdoc F : Under Windows . </s> PhD C : So I 'm not sure if {disfmarker} if {disfmarker} if we can use it . </s> Postdoc F : Mm - hmm . </s> PhD C : She said she would give it to us . </s> Postdoc F : Mm - hmm . </s> PhD C : It wouldn't be a problem .

Um , and , um , {vocalsound} the other thing , uh , which I 'll just say very briefly that maybe relates to that a little bit , which is that , um , uh , one of the suggestions that came up in a brief meeting I had the other day when I was in Spain with , uh , Manolo Pardo and {vocalsound} Javier , uh , Ferreiros , who was {pause} here before , was , um , why not start with what they had before but add in the non - silence boundaries . So , in what Javier did before when they were doing , um {disfmarker} h he was looking for , uh , speaker change {pause} points . </s> PhD D : Mm - hmm . </s> Professor G : Um . As a simplification , he originally did this only using {pause} silence as , uh , a {pause} putative , uh , speaker change point . </s> PhD C : Yeah . </s> Professor G : And , uh , he did not , say , look at points where you were changing broad sp uh , phonetic class , for instance . And for Broadcast News , that was fine . Here obviously it 's not . </s> PhD D : Yeah . </s> Professor G : And , um , so one of the things that they were pushing in d in discussing with me is , um , w why are you spending so much time , uh , on the , uh , feature issue , uh , when perhaps if you sort of deal with what you were using before </s> PhD D : Uh - huh . </s> Professor G : and then just broadened it a bit , instead of just ta using silence as putative change point also {disfmarker} ? </s> PhD D : Nnn , yeah . </s> Professor G : So then you 've got {disfmarker} you already have the super - structure with Gaussians and H - you know , simple H M Ms and so forth . And you {disfmarker} you might {disfmarker} So there was a {disfmarker} there was a little bit of a {disfmarker} a {disfmarker} a {disfmarker} a difference of opinion because I {disfmarker} I thought that it was {disfmarker} it 's interesting to look at what features are useful . </s> PhD D : Yeah . </s> Professor G : But , uh , on the other hand I saw that the {disfmarker} they had a good point that , uh , if we had something that worked for many cases before , maybe starting from there a little bit {disfmarker} Because ultimately we 're gonna end up {vocalsound} with some s su kind of structure like that , </s> PhD D : Yeah . </s> Professor G : where you have some kind of simple HMM and you 're testing the hypothesis that , {vocalsound} uh , there is a change . </s> PhD D : Yeah . </s> Professor G : So {disfmarker} so anyway , I just {disfmarker} reporting that . </s> PhD D : OK . </s> Professor G : But , uh , uh {disfmarker} So . Yeah , why don't we do the speech - nonspeech discussion ? </s> Postdoc F : Yeah . Do {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I hear {disfmarker} you {disfmarker} you didn't {disfmarker} </s> PhD C : Speech - nonspeech ? OK . </s> Postdoc F : Uh - huh . Yeah . </s> PhD C : Um , so , uh , what we basically did so far was using the mixed file to {disfmarker} to detect s speech or nonspeech {pause} portions in that . </s> Professor G : Mm - hmm . </s> PhD C : And what I did so far is I just used our old Munich system , which is an HMM - ba based system with Gaussian mixtures for s speech and nonspeech . And it was a system which used only one Gaussian for silence and one Gaussian for speech . And now I added , uh , multi - mixture possibility for {disfmarker} {vocalsound} for speech and nonspeech . </s> Professor G : Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . </s> PhD C : And I did some training on {disfmarker} on one dialogue , which was transcribed by {disfmarker} Yeah . We {disfmarker} we did a nons s speech - nonspeech transcription . </s> PhD D : Jose . </s> PhD C : Adam , Dave , and I , we did , for that dialogue and I trained it on that . And I did some pre - segmentations for {disfmarker} for Jane . And I 'm not sure how good they are or what {disfmarker} what the transcribers say . They {disfmarker} they can use it or {disfmarker} ? </s> Postdoc F : Uh , they {disfmarker} they think it 's a terrific improvement . And , um , it real it just makes a {disfmarker} a world of difference . </s> Professor G : Hmm . </s> Postdoc F : And , um , y you also did some something in addition which was , um , for those in which there {nonvocalsound} was , uh , quiet speakers in the mix . </s> PhD C : Yeah . Uh , yeah . That {disfmarker} that was one {disfmarker} one {disfmarker} one thing , uh , why I added more mixtures for {disfmarker} for the speech . So I saw that there were loud {disfmarker} loudly speaking speakers and quietly speaking speakers . </s> Professor G : Mm - hmm . </s> PhD C : And so I did two mixtures , one for the loud speakers and one for the quiet speakers . </s> Grad A : And did you hand - label who was loud and who was quiet , or did you just {disfmarker} ? </s> PhD C : I did that for {disfmarker} for five minutes of one dialogue </s> Grad A : Right . </s> PhD C : and that was enough to {disfmarker} to train the system . </s> PhD B : W What {disfmarker} ? </s> PhD D : Yeah . </s> PhD C : And so it {disfmarker} it adapts , uh , on {disfmarker} while running . So . </s> PhD B : What kind of , uh , front - end processing did you do ? </s> PhD C : Hopefully . </s> PhD D : OK . </s> PhD C : It 's just our {disfmarker} our old Munich , uh , loudness - based spectrum on mel scale twenty {disfmarker} twenty critical bands and then loudness . </s> PhD B : Mm - hmm . </s> PhD C : And four additional features , which is energy , loudness , modified loudness , and zero crossing rate . So it 's twenty - four {disfmarker} twenty - four features . </s> PhD B : Mmm . </s> Professor G : Mm - hmm . </s> Postdoc F : And you also provided me with several different versions , </s> PhD C : Yeah . </s> Postdoc F : which I compared . </s> PhD C : Yeah . </s> Postdoc F : And so you change {nonvocalsound} parameters . What {disfmarker} do you wanna say something about the parameters {nonvocalsound} that you change ? </s> PhD C : Yeah . You can specify {vocalsound} the minimum length of speech or {disfmarker} and silence portions which you want .

So, could you tell us a little bit about how you're working with Ministers and Cabinet Secretaries and other departments within the Government to safeguard these interests? </s> Eluned Morgan AM : So, as part of the employability programme, I have started going round every member of the Cabinet to ask what the impact will be on them\u2014for example, in health, and, certainly, the economy, but here are many other areas. What's important for us is that we do collaborate and we do get this analysis, but we hope to do that on the ground through the regional skills partnerships. That's our way of ensuring that we can have an understanding, on the ground, of what's needed by employers. And so ensuring that people feed into that and that we respond to those requirements\u2014that's where we're focusing our work. So, we're asking, for example, health boards to ensure that they feed into the regional skills partnerships. </s> Llyr Gruffydd AM : Is there a danger that we're a little bit behind in this process? Because Brexit could be upon us in no time at all, and, of course, this work is still ongoing. </s> Eluned Morgan AM : Well, I have been pushing and ensuring that in the direct areas facing the greatest risk, and agriculture's one of those, of course\u2014. We have been pushing to see what we can do further, so, for example, I'm in the process of developing a policy on rural skills at present because I do think it's important that we do focus on those sectors that are likely to suffer the worst impact if the worst does happen. So, those preparations are in place as far as they can be, but, of course, it's very difficult without knowing to what extent it's going to impact on us. </s> Llyr Gruffydd AM : And each sector's running on its own timescale, I would presume. But, as you've mentioned rural skills, when do you foresee that that work will appear, and when will plans or schemes or whatever you're intending to put in place see the light of day? </s> Eluned Morgan AM : Well, we hope during this term that that will be published or announced. So, certainly, it is something that we have been discussing with people in rural areas directly, with the colleges, to see what the provision is there and to what extent we need to expand that, and to what extent we will need to change and move really quickly if there is no deal. That's something that I think we have to learn and we need to convince the FE sector about in terms of moving more quickly and to be more responsive to the demand that there is in the workplace. </s> Llyr Gruffydd AM : Yes, because there is the dilemma you touched on earlier about providing the skills that are required for the economy and providing the courses that are easy to fill. That is a live discussion across FE and HE, but you're confident that that discussion is taking place in a constructive and positive way and moving in the right direction. </s> Eluned Morgan AM : Well, it's helped that we've put \u00a310 million on the table, because they do understand now that we are serious about our aim of ensuring that they do respond to what employers are asking for. So that has helped a lot in terms of focus and, of course, we're in the middle of a review now as well in terms of how we fund FE, and that will certainly be a part of that. </s> Llyr Gruffydd AM : Okay, thanks. </s> Lynne Neagle AM : Thank you.

Of course, that is in the context of a 'no deal' scenario. There could be a scenario where there are reciprocal arrangements, so, if a deal was reached with the European Union that established the principle of reciprocal arrangements, then, obviously, the ability of the HE institutions to charge international fees would be curtailed.

If you wanted to use the structured XML query language , that 's a different thing . And it 's a set of tools {vocalsound} that let you specify given the D - DDT {disfmarker} DTD of the document , um , what sorts of structural searches you want to do . So you want to say that , you know , you 're looking for , um , a tag within a tag within a particular tag that has this particular text in it , um , and , uh , refers to a particular value . And so the point isn't that an end - user , who is looking for a query like you specified , wouldn't program it in this language . What you would do is , someone would build a tool that used that as a library . So that they {disfmarker} so that you wouldn't have to construct the internal representations yourself . </s> PhD F : Is a {disfmarker} See , I think the kinds of questions , at least in the next {disfmarker} to the end of this year , are {disfmarker} there may be a lot of different ones , but they 'll all have a similar nature . They 'll be looking at either a word - level prosodic , uh , an {disfmarker} a value , </s> Grad C : Mm - hmm . </s> PhD F : like a continuous value , like the slope of something .

They 're not gonna be at the phone - level and they 're no not gonna be at the frame - level when we get done with sort of giving them simpler shapes and things . And so the main thing is just being able {disfmarker} Well , I guess , the two goals . Um , one that Chuck mentioned is starting out with something that we don't have to start over , that we don't have to throw away if other people want to extend it for other kinds of questions , </s> Grad C : Right . </s> PhD F : and being able to at least get enough , uh , information out on {disfmarker} where we condition the location of features on information that 's in the kind of file that you {pause} put up there . And that would {disfmarker} that would do it , </s> Grad C : Yeah . I think that there are quick and dirty solutions , </s> PhD F : I mean , for me . </s> Grad C : and then there are long - term , big - infrastructure solutions .

And especially that the representation doesn't have to be thrown away , </s> Grad C : Um {disfmarker} Right . </s> PhD F : even if your tools change . </s> Grad C : And so it seems to me that {disfmarker} I mean , I have to look at it again to see whether it can really do what we want , but if we use the ATLAS external file representation , um , it seems like it 's rich enough that you could do quick tools just as I said in Perl , and then later on if we choose to go up the learning curve , we can use the whole ATLAS inter infrastructure , </s> PhD F : Yeah . I mean , that sounds good to me . </s> Grad C : which has all that built in . </s> PhD F : I {disfmarker} I don't {disfmarker} So if {disfmarker} if you would l look at that and let us know what you think . </s> Grad C : Sure . </s> PhD F : I mean , I think we 're sort of guinea pigs , cuz I {disfmarker} I want to get the prosody work done but I don't want to waste time , you know , getting the {disfmarker} </s> PhD A : Oh , maybe {disfmarker} </s> PhD F : Yeah ? </s> PhD A : um {disfmarker} </s> Grad C : Well , I wouldn't wait for the formats , because anything you pick we 'll be able to translate to another form . </s> PhD A : Well {disfmarker} Ma well , maybe you should actually look at it yourself too to get a sense of what it is you 'll {disfmarker} you 'll be dealing with , </s> PhD F : OK . </s> PhD A : because , um , you know , Adam might have one opinion but you might have another , so </s> Grad B : Yeah . </s> PhD F : Yeah , definitely . </s> PhD A : I think the more eyes look at this the better . </s> PhD F : Especially if there 's , e um {disfmarker} you know , if someone can help with at least the {disfmarker} the setup of the right {disfmarker} </s> Grad C : Hi , Jane . </s> PhD F : Oh , hi . </s> PhD A : Mmm . </s> PhD F : the right representation , then , i you know , I hope it won't {disfmarker} We don't actually need the whole full - blown thing to be ready , </s> Grad C : Can you {disfmarker} Oh , well . </s> PhD F : so .

But , I mean , it is just something we developed at ICSI . </s> PhD A : Is there an {disfmarker} is there an IP - API ? </s> Grad C : And so {disfmarker} Yeah . </s> PhD A : OK . </s> Grad C : There 's an API for it . And , uh , </s> PhD A : There used to be a problem that they get too large , </s> Grad C : a bunch of libraries , P - file utilities . </s> PhD A : and so {pause} basically the {disfmarker} uh the filesystem wouldn't {disfmarker} </s> Grad C : Well , that 's gonna be a problem no matter what . You have the two - gigabyte limit on the filesystem size . And we definitely hit that with Broadcast News . </s> PhD A : Maybe you could extend the API to , uh , support , uh , like splitting up , you know , conceptually one file into smaller files on disk so that you can essentially , you know , have arbitrarily long f </s> Grad C : Yep . Most of the tools can handle that . </s> PhD A : Yeah . </s> Grad C : So that we didn't do it at the API - level . We did it at the t tool - level . That {disfmarker} that {disfmarker} most {disfmarker} many of them can s you can specify several P - files and they 'll just be done sequentially . </s> PhD A : OK . </s> Grad C : So . </s> PhD F : So , I guess , yeah , if {disfmarker} if you and Don can {disfmarker} if you can show him the P - file stuff and see . </s> Grad C : Sure . </s> PhD F : So this would be like for the F - zero {disfmarker} </s> Grad B : True . </s> Grad C : I mean , if you do \" man P - file \" or \" apropos P - file \" , you 'll see a lot . </s> Grad B : I 've used the P - file , I think .

You know , it was {disfmarker} I think it was Dave Johnson . So it 's all part of the Quicknet library . It has all the utilities for it . </s> PhD A : No , P - files were around way before Quicknet . P - files were {disfmarker} were around when {disfmarker} w with , um , {vocalsound} RAP . </s> Grad C : Oh , were they ? </s> PhD D : Mm - hmm . </s> PhD A : Right ? </s> PhD F : It 's like the history of ICSI . </s> PhD A : You worked with P - files . </s> Grad C : Mm - hmm . </s> PhD F : Like {disfmarker} </s> PhD D : No . </s> PhD A : I worked with P - files . </s> PhD F : Yeah ? </s> PhD D : I don't remember what the \" P \" is , though . </s> PhD A : No . </s> Grad C : But there are ni they 're {disfmarker} The {pause} Quicknet library has a bunch of things in it to handle P - files , </s> PhD A : Yeah . </s> Grad C : so it works pretty well . </s> PhD A : </s> PhD F : And that isn't really , I guess , as important as the {disfmarker} the main {disfmarker} I don't know what you call it , the {disfmarker} the main sort of word - level {disfmarker} </s> Grad C : Neither do I . </s> PhD D : Probably stands for \" Phil \" .

We've got some questions now specifically on prosecutions and potential alternatives from Vikki Howells. </s> Vikki Howells AM : Thank you, Chair. You've already touched quite a bit on the issue of the public interest test. Is there anything else you'd like to put on record about the factors that the CPS would be taking into consideration when applying the public interest test in respect of this Bill? </s> Barry Hughes : Can I give you an example, which might illustrate the way in which things could be different? This is one, which\u2014I give credit to Iwan for this, because he thought of it. If we take an adult with a small child\u2014say, a four-year-old\u2014in a supermarket, and the child is pulling cans off the shelves, it's quite annoying, and they keep doing it and keep doing it. The parent remonstrates, and the parent ends up finding that verbal admonishment is inadequate, and smacks the child lightly on the legs, which does the trick and the child stops. Presently, if someone in that supermarket were to report that to the police, I think the police would probably conclude that that is covered by the defence of reasonable chastisement. In other words, the evidential stage wouldn't be passed; you don't get on to consider the public interest. But if we have that same parent in there the following week, and you have the same happen again, presently, the defence would apply. Now, there comes a point in time when the defence stops applying. If that defence didn't apply at all, and we had a sequence of three offences, the public interest test would kick in, if I may put it like that, pretty quickly, because it would be repeated behaviour. So, that would be the distinction between how things are now and how they would be in the future, because the defence would not be available, so the public interest test would then come to the fore that much more quickly. So, when we apply the public interest test, the essence of it is about proportionality, and trying to come up with an approach that is proportionate to the offending. We look at the age of the offender, the age of the victim, we look at the circumstances, we look at the impact upon the victim, we look at the impact that's likely in relation to the suspect, and there is, within the code, a long list of matters that we take into account. Some of them are fairly obvious, such as previous convictions. If someone's got previous convictions for doing something wrong, it's more likely they're going to be prosecuted the next time. But there's no part of the law that says that prosecution will always follow. Mostly, it's reasonably obvious; the more serious an offence, the more likely you are to be prosecuted. </s> Vikki Howells AM : Thank you, that's really useful, and\u2014 </s> Lynne Neagle AM : Just before you move on, can I ask you a question? This morning the committee was meeting with groups of parents who are opposed to the Bill and groups of parents who are for the Bill, and one of the parents this morning was querying where the interests of the child would come into the public interest test. Now, I've looked at the code and there is a section about impact on the victim. Can you just clarify for the record how the best interests of the child would be taken into account in considering whether to go forward with a prosecution? </s> Barry Hughes : Normally, if there were an assault by someone else upon a child, outside the family, we would tend to take views from the parents of that child. In circumstances where both parents, arguably, are the suspects, we probably wouldn't be asking them. We would find another way, and we would talk with the police to ensure that we are informed about how the child feels about what has happened. It may be that there are\u2014. I can foresee real difficulties in circumstances where we have parents who are separating where the children are being used, effectively, in divorce proceedings, for example, where we might have one parent saying there was a really bad impact upon the child and the other parent saying there wasn't. We'd want to find a way to cut through that to work out really from the police how does the child feel about that. So, we would tailor it to the circumstances of the particular incident to assess how the child feels about it. It's not determinative, nor is it determinative in cases where we prosecute for adult defendants inflicting some form of assault upon adult victims. It's not determinative but it is a factor that we take into account. </s> Lynne Neagle AM : Okay, thank you. Suzy, you've got a supplementary on that. </s> Suzy Davies AM : Yes. In the same session this morning I thought this was an interesting question raised by a parent, on the rights of the child side of things, where if a parent offers a child two forms of punishment because that child has done something that they know they shouldn't have, and they're given the option of, 'You can have a quick smack and a cwtch, or you're going to your bedroom for quarter of an hour', and the child is allowed to choose and the child chooses the smack, what happens then? I'm not offering any views on the fact that this choice has been given, but it was put to us today about how would that fall in the law once it were changed. </s> Barry Hughes : That's a really interesting question. There is a body of law that\u2014 </s> Suzy Davies AM : A child can't consent to assault. </s> Barry Hughes : Yes, you can't consent to a serious assault, apart from in certain\u2014. The law is really quite difficult. So, for example, tattooing is a serious assault on one level, but you can consent to a tattoo. I can think of one case where a man branded his initials on a woman's buttocks, but she consented to it and the Court of Appeal held that they could consent to that. I can also think of a series of cases, which I won't get into here, that involve sadomasochistic behaviour between adults, some of which was really serious, and involved people willingly applying themselves to things that no sane person would do. And the Court of Appeal in that case, a case called Brown, said, 'No, that's going too far\u2014you can't consent to that.' Then, you may have seen there was a case from the midlands recently where a gentleman operating a tattoo parlour was also involved in body surgery\u2014splitting people's tongues. That went too far as well. So, there is again\u2014I referred before to the spectrum of offending, and there is a clear spectrum of offending that you can realistically consent to and then you get to offending you can't consent to. So, the law has considered that in some depth. I'm still not entirely clear, and I speak as a lawyer. When it comes to much lesser assaults, the law is more unclear as to what you can consent to. </s> Suzy Davies AM : Yes, because we're talking below a certain standard here as well.

I can foresee real difficulties in circumstances where we have parents who are separating where the children are being used, effectively, in divorce proceedings, for example, where we might have one parent saying there was a really bad impact upon the child and the other parent saying there wasn't. We'd want to find a way to cut through that to work out really from the police how does the child feel about that. So, we would tailor it to the circumstances of the particular incident to assess how the child feels about it.

I'm not offering any views on the fact that this choice has been given, but it was put to us today about how would that fall in the law once it were changed. </s> Barry Hughes : That's a really interesting question. There is a body of law that\u2014 </s> Suzy Davies AM : A child can't consent to assault. </s> Barry Hughes : Yes, you can't consent to a serious assault, apart from in certain\u2014. The law is really quite difficult. So, for example, tattooing is a serious assault on one level, but you can consent to a tattoo. I can think of one case where a man branded his initials on a woman's buttocks, but she consented to it and the Court of Appeal held that they could consent to that. I can also think of a series of cases, which I won't get into here, that involve sadomasochistic behaviour between adults, some of which was really serious, and involved people willingly applying themselves to things that no sane person would do. And the Court of Appeal in that case, a case called Brown, said, 'No, that's going too far\u2014you can't consent to that.' Then, you may have seen there was a case from the midlands recently where a gentleman operating a tattoo parlour was also involved in body surgery\u2014splitting people's tongues. That went too far as well. So, there is again\u2014I referred before to the spectrum of offending, and there is a clear spectrum of offending that you can realistically consent to and then you get to offending you can't consent to. So, the law has considered that in some depth. I'm still not entirely clear, and I speak as a lawyer.

This is one, which\u2014I give credit to Iwan for this, because he thought of it. If we take an adult with a small child\u2014say, a four-year-old\u2014in a supermarket, and the child is pulling cans off the shelves, it's quite annoying, and they keep doing it and keep doing it. The parent remonstrates, and the parent ends up finding that verbal admonishment is inadequate, and smacks the child lightly on the legs, which does the trick and the child stops. Presently, if someone in that supermarket were to report that to the police, I think the police would probably conclude that that is covered by the defence of reasonable chastisement. In other words, the evidential stage wouldn't be passed; you don't get on to consider the public interest. But if we have that same parent in there the following week, and you have the same happen again, presently, the defence would apply. Now, there comes a point in time when the defence stops applying. If that defence didn't apply at all, and we had a sequence of three offences, the public interest test would kick in, if I may put it like that, pretty quickly, because it would be repeated behaviour. So, that would be the distinction between how things are now and how they would be in the future, because the defence would not be available, so the public interest test would then come to the fore that much more quickly.

Um , uh , \" Car \" , I think , \" Babble \" , </s> PhD D : \" Babble . \" </s> PhD C : \" Subway \" , right ? and {disfmarker} </s> PhD D : \" Street \" or \" Airport \" or something . </s> PhD C : and {disfmarker} \" Street \" isn't {disfmarker} </s> PhD D : Or \" Train station \" . </s> PhD C : \" Train station \" , yeah . </s> PhD D : Yeah . </s> PhD C : So {disfmarker} it 's mostly {disfmarker} Well , \" Car \" is stationary , </s> Professor B : Mm - hmm . </s> PhD C : \" Babble \" , it 's a stationary background plus some voices , </s> Professor B : Mm - hmm . </s> PhD C : some speech over it . And the other two are rather stationary also . </s> Professor B : Well , I {disfmarker} I think that if you run it {disfmarker} Actually , you {disfmarker} maybe you remember this . When you {disfmarker} in {disfmarker} in the old experiments when you ran with the neural net only , and didn't have this side path , um , uh , with the {disfmarker} the pure features as well , did it make things better to have the neural net ? </s> PhD C : Mm - hmm . </s> Professor B : Was it about the same ? Uh , w i </s> PhD C : It was {disfmarker} b a little bit worse . </s> Professor B : Than {disfmarker} ? </s> PhD C : Than just the features , yeah . </s> Professor B : So , until you put the second path in with the pure features , the neural net wasn't helping at all . </s> PhD C : Mm - hmm . </s> Professor B : Well , that 's interesting . </s> PhD C : It was helping , uh , if the features are b were bad , </s> Professor B : Yeah . </s> PhD C : I mean . Just plain P L Ps or M F </s> Professor B : Yeah . </s> PhD C : C Cs . as soon as we added LDA on - line normalization , and {vocalsound} all these things , then {disfmarker} </s> Professor B : They were doing similar enough things . Well , I still think it would be k sort of interesting to see what would happen if you just had the neural net without the side thing . </s> PhD C : Yeah , </s> Professor B : And {disfmarker} and the thing I {disfmarker} I have in mind is , uh , maybe you 'll see that the results are not just a little bit worse . </s> PhD C : mm - hmm . </s> Professor B : Maybe that they 're a lot worse . You know ? And , um {disfmarker} But if on the ha other hand , uh , it 's , say , somewhere in between what you 're seeing now and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and , uh , what you 'd have with just the pure features , then maybe there is some problem of a {disfmarker} of a , uh , combination of these things , or correlation between them somehow . </s> PhD C : Mm - hmm . </s> Professor B : If it really is that the net is hurting you at the moment , then I think the issue is to focus on {disfmarker} on , uh , improving the {disfmarker} the net . </s> PhD C : Yeah , </s> Professor B : Um . </s> PhD C : mm - hmm . </s> Professor B : So what 's the overall effe I mean , you haven't done all the experiments but you said it was i somewhat better , say , five percent better , for the first two conditions , and fifteen percent worse for the other one ? But it 's {disfmarker} but of course that one 's weighted lower , </s> PhD C : Y yeah , oh . Yeah . </s> Professor B : so I wonder what the net effect is . </s> PhD C : I d I {disfmarker} I think it 's {disfmarker} it was one or two percent . That 's not that bad , but it was l like two percent relative worse on SpeechDat - Car . I have to {disfmarker} to check that . Well , I have {disfmarker} I will . </s> PhD D : Well , it will {disfmarker} overall it will be still better even if it is fifteen percent worse , because the fifteen percent worse is given like f w twenty - five {disfmarker} point two five eight . </s> Professor B : Right . </s> PhD C : Mm - hmm . Hmm . </s> Professor B : Right . So the {disfmarker} so the worst it could be , if the others were exactly the same , is four , </s> PhD D : Is it like {disfmarker} </s> Professor B : and {disfmarker} and , uh , in fact since the others are somewhat better {disfmarker} </s> PhD D : Yeah , so it 's four . Is i So either it 'll get cancelled out , or you 'll get , like , almost the same . </s> Professor B : Uh . </s> PhD C : Yeah , it was {disfmarker} it was slightly worse . </s> PhD D : Slightly bad . Yeah . </s> PhD C : Um , </s> Professor B : Yeah , it should be pretty close to cancelled out . </s> PhD D : Yeah . </s> PhD A : You know , I 've been wondering about something . </s> PhD C : Mm - hmm . </s> PhD A : In the , um {disfmarker} a lot of the , um {disfmarker} the Hub - five systems , um , recently have been using LDA . and {disfmarker} and they , um {disfmarker} They run LDA on the features right before they train the models . So there 's the {disfmarker} the LDA is {disfmarker} is right there before the H M </s> PhD D : Yeah . </s> PhD A : So , you guys are using LDA but it seems like it 's pretty far back in the process . </s> PhD D : Uh , this LDA is different from the LDA that you are talking about . The LDA that you {disfmarker} saying is , like , you take a block of features , like nine frames or something , {comment} and then do an LDA on it , </s> PhD A : Yeah . Uh - huh . </s> PhD D : and then reduce the dimensionality to something like twenty - four or something like that . </s> PhD A : Yeah , you c you c you can . </s> PhD D : And then feed it to HMM . </s> PhD A : I mean , it 's {disfmarker} you know , you 're just basically i </s> PhD D : Yeah , so this is like a two d two dimensional tile . </s> PhD A : You 're shifting the feature space . Yeah . </s> PhD D : So this is a two dimensional tile . And the LDA that we are f applying is only in time , not in frequency {disfmarker} high cost frequency . So it 's like {disfmarker} more like a filtering in time , rather than doing a r </s> PhD A : Ah . OK . So what i what about , um {disfmarker} i u what i w I mean , I don't know if this is a good idea or not , but what if you put {disfmarker} ran the other kind of LDA , uh , on your features right before they go into the HMM ? </s> PhD D : Uh , it {disfmarker} </s> PhD C : Mm - hmm . No , actually , I think {disfmarker} i </s> PhD D : m </s> PhD C : Well . What do we do with the ANN is {disfmarker} is something like that except that it 's not linear . But it 's {disfmarker} it 's like a nonlinear discriminant analysis . </s> PhD A : Yeah . Right , it 's the {disfmarker} It 's {disfmarker} Right . The {disfmarker} So {disfmarker} Yeah , so it 's sort of like {disfmarker} </s> PhD C : But . </s> PhD A : The tandem stuff is kind of like i nonlinear LDA . </s> PhD C : Yeah . It 's {disfmarker} </s> PhD A : I g </s> PhD C : Yeah . </s> PhD A : Yeah . </s> Professor B : Yeah . </s> PhD A : But I mean , w but the other features that you have , um , th the non - tandem ones , </s> PhD C : Uh . Mm - hmm . Yeah , I know . That {disfmarker} that {disfmarker} Yeah . Well , in the proposal , they were transformed u using PCA , but {disfmarker} </s> PhD A : Uh - huh . </s> PhD C : Yeah , it might be that LDA could be better . </s> Professor B : The a the argument i is kind of i in {disfmarker} and it 's not like we really know , but the argument anyway is that , um , uh , we always have the prob I mean , discriminative things are good . LDA , neural nets , they 're good . </s> PhD A : Yeah . </s> Professor B : Uh , they 're good because you {disfmarker} you {disfmarker} you learn to distinguish between these categories that you want to be good at distinguishing between . And PCA doesn't do that . It {disfmarker} PAC - PCA {disfmarker} low - order PCA throws away pieces that are uh , maybe not {disfmarker} not gonna be helpful just because they 're small , basically . </s> PhD A : Right . </s> Professor B : But , uh , the problem is , training sets aren't perfect and testing sets are different . So you f you {disfmarker} you face the potential problem with discriminative stuff , be it LDA or neural nets , that you are training to discriminate between categories in one space but what you 're really gonna be g getting is {disfmarker} is something else . </s> PhD A : Uh - huh . </s> Professor B : And so , uh , Stephane 's idea was , uh , let 's feed , uh , both this discriminatively trained thing and something that 's not . So you have a good set of features that everybody 's worked really hard to make , </s> PhD A : Yeah . </s> Professor B : and then , uh , you {disfmarker} you discriminately train it , but you also take the path that {disfmarker} that doesn't have that , </s> PhD A : Uh - huh . </s> Professor B : and putting those in together . And that {disfmarker} that seem So it 's kind of like a combination of the {disfmarker} uh , what , uh , Dan has been calling , you know , a feature {disfmarker} uh , you know , a feature combination versus posterior combination or something . It 's {disfmarker} it 's , you know , you have the posterior combination but then you get the features from that and use them as a feature combination with these {disfmarker} these other things . And that seemed , at least in the last one , as he was just saying , he {disfmarker} he {disfmarker} when he only did discriminative stuff , i it actually was {disfmarker} was {disfmarker} it didn't help at all in this particular case . </s> PhD A : Yeah . </s> Professor B : There was enough of a difference , I guess , between the testing and training . But by having them both there {disfmarker} The fact is some of the time , the discriminative stuff is gonna help you . </s> PhD A : Mm - hmm . </s> Professor B : And some of the time it 's going to hurt you , </s> PhD A : Right . </s> Professor B : and by combining two information sources if , you know {disfmarker} if {disfmarker} if {disfmarker} </s> PhD A : So you wouldn't necessarily then want to do LDA on the non - tandem features because now you 're doing something to them that {disfmarker} </s> Professor B : That i i I think that 's counter to that idea . </s> PhD A : Yeah , right . </s> Professor B : Now , again , it 's {disfmarker} we 're just trying these different things . We don't really know what 's gonna work best . But if that 's the hypothesis , at least it would be counter to that hypothesis to do that . </s> PhD A : Right . </s> Professor B : Um , and in principle you would think that the neural net would do better at the discriminant part than LDA . </s> PhD A : Right . Yeah . Well {disfmarker} y </s> Professor B : Though , maybe not . </s> PhD A : Yeah . Exactly . I mean , we , uh {disfmarker} we were getting ready to do the tandem , uh , stuff for the Hub - five system , and , um , Andreas and I talked about it , and the idea w the thought was , \" Well , uh , yeah , that i you know {disfmarker} th the neural net should be better , but we should at least have uh , a number , you know , to show that we did try the LDA in place of the neural net , so that we can you know , show a clear path . </s> Professor B : Right . </s> PhD A : You know , that you have it without it , then you have the LDA , then you have the neural net , and you can see , theoretically . So . I was just wondering {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} </s> Professor B : Well , I think that 's a good idea . </s> PhD A : Yeah . </s> Professor B : Did {disfmarker} did you do that </s> PhD A : Um . No . </s> Professor B : or {disfmarker} tha that 's a {disfmarker} </s> PhD A : That 's what {disfmarker} that 's what we 're gonna do next as soon as I finish this other thing . So . </s> Professor B : Yeah . Yeah . No , well , that 's a good idea . I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} </s> PhD A : We just want to show . </s> Professor B : i Yeah . </s> PhD A : I mean , it {disfmarker} everybody believes it , </s> Professor B : Oh , no it 's a g </s> PhD A : but you know , we just {disfmarker} </s> Professor B : No , no , but it might not {disfmarker} not even be true . </s> PhD A : Yeah . </s> Professor B : I mean , it 's {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} it 's a great idea . I mean , one of the things that always disturbed me , uh , in the {disfmarker} the resurgence of neural nets that happened in the eighties was that , um , a lot of people {disfmarker} Because neural nets were pretty easy to {disfmarker} to use {disfmarker} a lot of people were just using them for all sorts of things without , uh , looking at all into the linear , uh {disfmarker} uh , versions of them . </s> PhD A : Yeah . Mm - hmm . Yeah . </s> Professor B : And , uh , people were doing recurrent nets but not looking at IIR filters , and {disfmarker} You know , I mean , uh , so I think , yeah , it 's definitely a good idea to try it . </s> PhD A : Yeah , and everybody 's putting that on their {vocalsound} systems now , and so , I that 's what made me wonder about this , </s> Professor B : Well , they 've been putting them in their systems off and on for ten years , </s> PhD A : but . </s> Professor B : but {disfmarker} but {disfmarker} but , uh , </s> PhD A : Yeah , what I mean is it 's {disfmarker} it 's like in the Hub - five evaluations , you know , and you read the system descriptions and everybody 's got , {vocalsound} you know , LDA on their features . </s> Professor B : And now they all have that . I see . </s> PhD A : And so . </s> Professor B : Yeah . </s> PhD A : Uh . </s> PhD C : It 's the transformation they 're estimating on {disfmarker} Well , they are trained on the same data as the final HMM are . </s> PhD A : Yeah , so it 's different . Yeah , exactly . Cuz they don't have these , you know , mismatches that {disfmarker} that you guys have . </s> PhD C : Mm - hmm . </s> PhD A : So that 's why I was wondering if maybe it 's not even a good idea . </s> PhD C : Mm - hmm . </s> PhD A : I don't know . I {disfmarker} I don't know enough about it , </s> PhD C : Mm - hmm . </s> PhD A : but {disfmarker} Um . </s> Professor B : I mean , part of why {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I think part of why you were getting into the KLT {disfmarker} Y you were describing to me at one point that you wanted to see if , uh , you know , getting good orthogonal features was {disfmarker} and combining the {disfmarker} the different temporal ranges {disfmarker} was the key thing that was happening or whether it was this discriminant thing , right ? So you were just trying {disfmarker} I think you r I mean , this is {disfmarker} it doesn't have the LDA aspect but th as far as the orthogonalizing transformation , you were trying that at one point , right ? </s> PhD C : Mm - hmm . </s> Professor B : I think you were . </s> PhD C : Mm - hmm . Yeah . </s> Professor B : Does something . It doesn't work as well . Yeah . Yeah .",

I mean , one of the things that always disturbed me , uh , in the {disfmarker} the resurgence of neural nets that happened in the eighties was that , um , a lot of people {disfmarker} Because neural nets were pretty easy to {disfmarker} to use {disfmarker} a lot of people were just using them for all sorts of things without , uh , looking at all into the linear , uh {disfmarker} uh , versions of them . </s> PhD A : Yeah . Mm - hmm . Yeah . </s> Professor B : And , uh , people were doing recurrent nets but not looking at IIR filters , and {disfmarker} You know , I mean , uh , so I think , yeah , it 's definitely a good idea to try it . </s> PhD A : Yeah , and everybody 's putting that on their {vocalsound} systems now , and so , I that 's what made me wonder about this , </s> Professor B : Well , they 've been putting them in their systems off and on for ten years , </s> PhD A : but . </s> Professor B : but {disfmarker} but {disfmarker} but , uh , </s> PhD A : Yeah , what I mean is it 's {disfmarker} it 's like in the Hub - five evaluations , you know , and you read the system descriptions and everybody 's got , {vocalsound} you know , LDA on their features . </s> Professor B : And now they all have that . I see . </s> PhD A : And so . </s> Professor B : Yeah . </s> PhD A : Uh . </s> PhD C : It 's the transformation they 're estimating on {disfmarker} Well , they are trained on the same data as the final HMM are . </s> PhD A : Yeah , so it 's different . Yeah , exactly .

When you {disfmarker} in {disfmarker} in the old experiments when you ran with the neural net only , and didn't have this side path , um , uh , with the {disfmarker} the pure features as well , did it make things better to have the neural net ? </s> PhD C : Mm - hmm . </s> Professor B : Was it about the same ?

Well , I still think it would be k sort of interesting to see what would happen if you just had the neural net without the side thing . </s> PhD C : Yeah , </s> Professor B : And {disfmarker} and the thing I {disfmarker} I have in mind is , uh , maybe you 'll see that the results are not just a little bit worse . </s> PhD C : mm - hmm . </s> Professor B : Maybe that they 're a lot worse . You know ? And , um {disfmarker} But if on the ha other hand , uh , it 's , say , somewhere in between what you 're seeing now and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and , uh , what you 'd have with just the pure features , then maybe there is some problem of a {disfmarker} of a , uh , combination of these things , or correlation between them somehow . </s> PhD C : Mm - hmm . </s> Professor B : If it really is that the net is hurting you at the moment , then I think the issue is to focus on {disfmarker} on , uh , improving the {disfmarker} the net . </s> PhD C : Yeah , </s> Professor B : Um . </s> PhD C : mm - hmm . </s> Professor B : So what 's the overall effe I mean , you haven't done all the experiments but you said it was i somewhat better , say , five percent better , for the first two conditions , and fifteen percent worse for the other one ? But it 's {disfmarker} but of course that one 's weighted lower , </s> PhD C : Y yeah , oh . Yeah . </s> Professor B : so I wonder what the net effect is . </s> PhD C : I d I {disfmarker} I think it 's {disfmarker} it was one or two percent . That 's not that bad , but it was l like two percent relative worse on SpeechDat - Car . I have to {disfmarker} to check that . Well , I have {disfmarker} I will . </s> PhD D : Well , it will {disfmarker} overall it will be still better even if it is fifteen percent worse , because the fifteen percent worse is given like f w twenty - five {disfmarker} point two five eight . </s> Professor B : Right . </s> PhD C : Mm - hmm . Hmm . </s> Professor B : Right . So the {disfmarker} so the worst it could be , if the others were exactly the same , is four , </s> PhD D : Is it like {disfmarker} </s> Professor B : and {disfmarker} and , uh , in fact since the others are somewhat better {disfmarker} </s> PhD D : Yeah , so it 's four . Is i So either it 'll get cancelled out , or you 'll get , like , almost the same . </s> Professor B : Uh . </s> PhD C : Yeah , it was {disfmarker} it was slightly worse . </s> PhD D : Slightly bad . Yeah . </s> PhD C : Um , </s> Professor B : Yeah , it should be pretty close to cancelled out . </s> PhD D : Yeah . </s> PhD A : You know , I 've been wondering about something . </s> PhD C : Mm - hmm . </s> PhD A : In the , um {disfmarker} a lot of the , um {disfmarker} the Hub - five systems , um , recently have been using LDA . and {disfmarker} and they , um {disfmarker} They run LDA on the features right before they train the models . So there 's the {disfmarker} the LDA is {disfmarker} is right there before the H M </s> PhD D : Yeah . </s> PhD A : So , you guys are using LDA but it seems like it 's pretty far back in the process . </s> PhD D : Uh , this LDA is different from the LDA that you are talking about . The LDA that you {disfmarker} saying is , like , you take a block of features , like nine frames or something , {comment} and then do an LDA on it , </s> PhD A : Yeah . Uh - huh . </s> PhD D : and then reduce the dimensionality to something like twenty - four or something like that . </s> PhD A : Yeah , you c you c you can . </s> PhD D : And then feed it to HMM . </s> PhD A : I mean , it 's {disfmarker} you know , you 're just basically i </s> PhD D : Yeah , so this is like a two d two dimensional tile . </s> PhD A : You 're shifting the feature space . Yeah . </s> PhD D : So this is a two dimensional tile . And the LDA that we are f applying is only in time , not in frequency {disfmarker} high cost frequency . So it 's like {disfmarker} more like a filtering in time , rather than doing a r </s> PhD A : Ah . OK . So what i what about , um {disfmarker} i u what i w I mean , I don't know if this is a good idea or not , but what if you put {disfmarker} ran the other kind of LDA , uh , on your features right before they go into the HMM ? </s> PhD D : Uh , it {disfmarker} </s> PhD C : Mm - hmm . No , actually , I think {disfmarker} i </s> PhD D : m </s> PhD C : Well . What do we do with the ANN is {disfmarker} is something like that except that it 's not linear . But it 's {disfmarker} it 's like a nonlinear discriminant analysis . </s> PhD A : Yeah . Right , it 's the {disfmarker} It 's {disfmarker} Right . The {disfmarker} So {disfmarker} Yeah , so it 's sort of like {disfmarker} </s> PhD C : But . </s> PhD A : The tandem stuff is kind of like i nonlinear LDA . </s> PhD C : Yeah . It 's {disfmarker} </s> PhD A : I g </s> PhD C : Yeah . </s> PhD A : Yeah . </s> Professor B : Yeah . </s> PhD A : But I mean , w but the other features that you have , um , th the non - tandem ones , </s> PhD C : Uh . Mm - hmm . Yeah , I know . That {disfmarker} that {disfmarker} Yeah . Well , in the proposal , they were transformed u using PCA , but {disfmarker} </s> PhD A : Uh - huh . </s> PhD C : Yeah , it might be that LDA could be better . </s> Professor B : The a the argument i is kind of i in {disfmarker} and it 's not like we really know , but the argument anyway is that , um , uh , we always have the prob I mean , discriminative things are good . LDA , neural nets , they 're good . </s> PhD A : Yeah . </s> Professor B : Uh , they 're good because you {disfmarker} you {disfmarker} you learn to distinguish between these categories that you want to be good at distinguishing between . And PCA doesn't do that . It {disfmarker} PAC - PCA {disfmarker} low - order PCA throws away pieces that are uh , maybe not {disfmarker} not gonna be helpful just because they 're small , basically . </s> PhD A : Right . </s> Professor B : But , uh , the problem is , training sets aren't perfect and testing sets are different . So you f you {disfmarker} you face the potential problem with discriminative stuff , be it LDA or neural nets , that you are training to discriminate between categories in one space but what you 're really gonna be g getting is {disfmarker} is something else . </s> PhD A : Uh - huh . </s> Professor B : And so , uh , Stephane 's idea was , uh , let 's feed , uh , both this discriminatively trained thing and something that 's not . So you have a good set of features that everybody 's worked really hard to make , </s> PhD A : Yeah . </s> Professor B : and then , uh , you {disfmarker} you discriminately train it , but you also take the path that {disfmarker} that doesn't have that , </s> PhD A : Uh - huh . </s> Professor B : and putting those in together . And that {disfmarker} that seem So it 's kind of like a combination of the {disfmarker} uh , what , uh , Dan has been calling , you know , a feature {disfmarker} uh , you know , a feature combination versus posterior combination or something . It 's {disfmarker} it 's , you know , you have the posterior combination but then you get the features from that and use them as a feature combination with these {disfmarker} these other things . And that seemed , at least in the last one , as he was just saying , he {disfmarker} he {disfmarker} when he only did discriminative stuff , i it actually was {disfmarker} was {disfmarker} it didn't help at all in this particular case . </s> PhD A : Yeah . </s> Professor B : There was enough of a difference , I guess , between the testing and training . But by having them both there {disfmarker} The fact is some of the time , the discriminative stuff is gonna help you . </s> PhD A : Mm - hmm . </s> Professor B : And some of the time it 's going to hurt you , </s> PhD A : Right . </s> Professor B : and by combining two information sources if , you know {disfmarker} if {disfmarker} if {disfmarker} </s> PhD A : So you wouldn't necessarily then want to do LDA on the non - tandem features because now you 're doing something to them that {disfmarker} </s> Professor B : That i i I think that 's counter to that idea . </s> PhD A : Yeah , right . </s> Professor B : Now , again , it 's {disfmarker} we 're just trying these different things . We don't really know what 's gonna work best . But if that 's the hypothesis , at least it would be counter to that hypothesis to do that . </s> PhD A : Right . </s> Professor B : Um , and in principle you would think that the neural net would do better at the discriminant part than LDA . </s> PhD A : Right .

Yeah . </s> Professor B : so I wonder what the net effect is . </s> PhD C : I d I {disfmarker} I think it 's {disfmarker} it was one or two percent .

Well , I have {disfmarker} I will . </s> PhD D : Well , it will {disfmarker} overall it will be still better even if it is fifteen percent worse , because the fifteen percent worse is given like f w twenty - five {disfmarker} point two five eight . </s> Professor B : Right . </s> PhD C : Mm - hmm .

So the {disfmarker} so the worst it could be , if the others were exactly the same , is four , </s> PhD D : Is it like {disfmarker} </s> Professor B : and {disfmarker} and , uh , in fact since the others are somewhat better {disfmarker} </s> PhD D : Yeah , so it 's four .

The LDA that you {disfmarker} saying is , like , you take a block of features , like nine frames or something , {comment} and then do an LDA on it , </s> PhD A : Yeah . Uh - huh . </s> PhD D : and then reduce the dimensionality to something like twenty - four or something like that . </s> PhD A : Yeah , you c you c you can . </s> PhD D : And then feed it to HMM . </s> PhD A : I mean , it 's {disfmarker} you know , you 're just basically i </s> PhD D : Yeah , so this is like a two d two dimensional tile . </s> PhD A : You 're shifting the feature space . Yeah . </s> PhD D : So this is a two dimensional tile . And the LDA that we are f applying is only in time , not in frequency {disfmarker} high cost frequency . So it 's like {disfmarker} more like a filtering in time , rather than doing a r </s> PhD A : Ah . OK . So what i what about , um {disfmarker} i u what i w I mean , I don't know if this is a good idea or not , but what if you put {disfmarker} ran the other kind of LDA , uh , on your features right before they go into the HMM ? </s> PhD D : Uh , it {disfmarker} </s> PhD C : Mm - hmm . No , actually , I think {disfmarker} i </s> PhD D : m </s> PhD C : Well . What do we do with the ANN is {disfmarker} is something like that except that it 's not linear . But it 's {disfmarker} it 's like a nonlinear discriminant analysis . </s> PhD A : Yeah . Right , it 's the {disfmarker} It 's {disfmarker} Right . The {disfmarker} So {disfmarker} Yeah , so it 's sort of like {disfmarker} </s> PhD C : But . </s> PhD A : The tandem stuff is kind of like i nonlinear LDA . </s> PhD C : Yeah .

LDA , neural nets , they 're good . </s> PhD A : Yeah . </s> Professor B : Uh , they 're good because you {disfmarker} you {disfmarker} you learn to distinguish between these categories that you want to be good at distinguishing between . And PCA doesn't do that . It {disfmarker} PAC - PCA {disfmarker} low - order PCA throws away pieces that are uh , maybe not {disfmarker} not gonna be helpful just because they 're small , basically . </s> PhD A : Right . </s> Professor B : But , uh , the problem is , training sets aren't perfect and testing sets are different . So you f you {disfmarker} you face the potential problem with discriminative stuff , be it LDA or neural nets , that you are training to discriminate between categories in one space but what you 're really gonna be g getting is {disfmarker} is something else . </s> PhD A : Uh - huh . </s> Professor B : And so , uh , Stephane 's idea was , uh , let 's feed , uh , both this discriminatively trained thing and something that 's not . So you have a good set of features that everybody 's worked really hard to make , </s> PhD A : Yeah . </s> Professor B : and then , uh , you {disfmarker} you discriminately train it , but you also take the path that {disfmarker} that doesn't have that , </s> PhD A : Uh - huh . </s> Professor B : and putting those in together . And that {disfmarker} that seem So it 's kind of like a combination of the {disfmarker} uh , what , uh , Dan has been calling , you know , a feature {disfmarker} uh , you know , a feature combination versus posterior combination or something . It 's {disfmarker} it 's , you know , you have the posterior combination but then you get the features from that and use them as a feature combination with these {disfmarker} these other things . And that seemed , at least in the last one , as he was just saying , he {disfmarker} he {disfmarker} when he only did discriminative stuff , i it actually was {disfmarker} was {disfmarker} it didn't help at all in this particular case . </s> PhD A : Yeah . </s> Professor B : There was enough of a difference , I guess , between the testing and training . But by having them both there {disfmarker} The fact is some of the time , the discriminative stuff is gonna help you . </s> PhD A : Mm - hmm . </s> Professor B : And some of the time it 's going to hurt you , </s> PhD A : Right . </s> Professor B : and by combining two information sources if , you know {disfmarker} if {disfmarker} if {disfmarker} </s> PhD A : So you wouldn't necessarily then want to do LDA on the non - tandem features because now you 're doing something to them that {disfmarker} </s> Professor B : That i i I think that 's counter to that idea . </s> PhD A : Yeah , right . </s> Professor B : Now , again , it 's {disfmarker} we 're just trying these different things . We don't really know what 's gonna work best . But if that 's the hypothesis , at least it would be counter to that hypothesis to do that . </s> PhD A : Right . </s> Professor B : Um , and in principle you would think that the neural net would do better at the discriminant part than LDA . </s> PhD A : Right . Yeah . Well {disfmarker} y </s> Professor B : Though , maybe not . </s> PhD A : Yeah . Exactly . I mean , we , uh {disfmarker} we were getting ready to do the tandem , uh , stuff for the Hub - five system , and , um , Andreas and I talked about it , and the idea w the thought was , \" Well , uh , yeah , that i you know {disfmarker} th the neural net should be better , but we should at least have uh , a number , you know , to show that we did try the LDA in place of the neural net , so that we can you know , show a clear path . </s> Professor B : Right . </s> PhD A : You know , that you have it without it , then you have the LDA , then you have the neural net , and you can see , theoretically . So . I was just wondering {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} </s> Professor B : Well , I think that 's a good idea . </s> PhD A : Yeah . </s> Professor B : Did {disfmarker} did you do that </s> PhD A : Um . No . </s> Professor B : or {disfmarker} tha that 's a {disfmarker} </s> PhD A : That 's what {disfmarker} that 's what we 're gonna do next as soon as I finish this other thing .

I mean , one of the things that always disturbed me , uh , in the {disfmarker} the resurgence of neural nets that happened in the eighties was that , um , a lot of people {disfmarker} Because neural nets were pretty easy to {disfmarker} to use {disfmarker} a lot of people were just using them for all sorts of things without , uh , looking at all into the linear , uh {disfmarker} uh , versions of them . </s> PhD A : Yeah . Mm - hmm . Yeah . </s> Professor B : And , uh , people were doing recurrent nets but not looking at IIR filters , and {disfmarker} You know , I mean , uh , so I think , yeah , it 's definitely a good idea to try it . </s> PhD A : Yeah , and everybody 's putting that on their {vocalsound} systems now , and so , I that 's what made me wonder about this , </s> Professor B : Well , they 've been putting them in their systems off and on for ten years , </s> PhD A : but . </s> Professor B : but {disfmarker} but {disfmarker} but , uh , </s> PhD A : Yeah , what I mean is it 's {disfmarker} it 's like in the Hub - five evaluations , you know , and you read the system descriptions and everybody 's got , {vocalsound} you know , LDA on their features . </s> Professor B : And now they all have that . I see . </s> PhD A : And so . </s> Professor B : Yeah . </s> PhD A : Uh . </s> PhD C : It 's the transformation they 're estimating on {disfmarker} Well , they are trained on the same data as the final HMM are . </s> PhD A : Yeah , so it 's different . Yeah , exactly . Cuz they don't have these , you know , mismatches that {disfmarker} that you guys have . </s> PhD C : Mm - hmm . </s> PhD A : So that 's why I was wondering if maybe it 's not even a good idea . </s> PhD C : Mm - hmm . </s> PhD A : I don't know . I {disfmarker} I don't know enough about it , </s> PhD C : Mm - hmm . </s> PhD A : but {disfmarker} Um . </s> Professor B : I mean , part of why {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I think part of why you were getting into the KLT {disfmarker} Y you were describing to me at one point that you wanted to see if , uh , you know , getting good orthogonal features was {disfmarker} and combining the {disfmarker} the different temporal ranges {disfmarker} was the key thing that was happening or whether it was this discriminant thing , right ? So you were just trying {disfmarker} I think you r I mean , this is {disfmarker} it doesn't have the LDA aspect but th as far as the orthogonalizing transformation , you were trying that at one point , right ? </s> PhD C : Mm - hmm . </s> Professor B : I think you were . </s> PhD C : Mm - hmm .

Yeah . </s> PhD C : Um , </s> Professor B : Yeah , it should be pretty close to cancelled out . </s> PhD D : Yeah . </s> PhD A : You know , I 've been wondering about something . </s> PhD C : Mm - hmm . </s> PhD A : In the , um {disfmarker} a lot of the , um {disfmarker} the Hub - five systems , um , recently have been using LDA . and {disfmarker} and they , um {disfmarker} They run LDA on the features right before they train the models . So there 's the {disfmarker} the LDA is {disfmarker} is right there before the H M </s> PhD D : Yeah . </s> PhD A : So , you guys are using LDA but it seems like it 's pretty far back in the process . </s> PhD D : Uh , this LDA is different from the LDA that you are talking about . The LDA that you {disfmarker} saying is , like , you take a block of features , like nine frames or something , {comment} and then do an LDA on it , </s> PhD A : Yeah . Uh - huh . </s> PhD D : and then reduce the dimensionality to something like twenty - four or something like that . </s> PhD A : Yeah , you c you c you can . </s> PhD D : And then feed it to HMM . </s> PhD A : I mean , it 's {disfmarker} you know , you 're just basically i </s> PhD D : Yeah , so this is like a two d two dimensional tile . </s> PhD A : You 're shifting the feature space . Yeah . </s> PhD D : So this is a two dimensional tile . And the LDA that we are f applying is only in time , not in frequency {disfmarker} high cost frequency . So it 's like {disfmarker} more like a filtering in time , rather than doing a r </s> PhD A : Ah . OK . So what i what about , um {disfmarker} i u what i w I mean , I don't know if this is a good idea or not , but what if you put {disfmarker} ran the other kind of LDA , uh , on your features right before they go into the HMM ? </s> PhD D : Uh , it {disfmarker} </s> PhD C : Mm - hmm . No , actually , I think {disfmarker} i </s> PhD D : m </s> PhD C : Well . What do we do with the ANN is {disfmarker} is something like that except that it 's not linear . But it 's {disfmarker} it 's like a nonlinear discriminant analysis . </s> PhD A : Yeah . Right , it 's the {disfmarker} It 's {disfmarker} Right . The {disfmarker} So {disfmarker} Yeah , so it 's sort of like {disfmarker} </s> PhD C : But . </s> PhD A : The tandem stuff is kind of like i nonlinear LDA . </s> PhD C : Yeah . It 's {disfmarker} </s> PhD A : I g </s> PhD C : Yeah . </s> PhD A : Yeah . </s> Professor B : Yeah . </s> PhD A : But I mean , w but the other features that you have , um , th the non - tandem ones , </s> PhD C : Uh . Mm - hmm . Yeah , I know . That {disfmarker} that {disfmarker} Yeah . Well , in the proposal , they were transformed u using PCA , but {disfmarker} </s> PhD A : Uh - huh . </s> PhD C : Yeah , it might be that LDA could be better . </s> Professor B : The a the argument i is kind of i in {disfmarker} and it 's not like we really know , but the argument anyway is that , um , uh , we always have the prob I mean , discriminative things are good . LDA , neural nets , they 're good . </s> PhD A : Yeah . </s> Professor B : Uh , they 're good because you {disfmarker} you {disfmarker} you learn to distinguish between these categories that you want to be good at distinguishing between . And PCA doesn't do that . It {disfmarker} PAC - PCA {disfmarker} low - order PCA throws away pieces that are uh , maybe not {disfmarker} not gonna be helpful just because they 're small , basically . </s> PhD A : Right . </s> Professor B : But , uh , the problem is , training sets aren't perfect and testing sets are different . So you f you {disfmarker} you face the potential problem with discriminative stuff , be it LDA or neural nets , that you are training to discriminate between categories in one space but what you 're really gonna be g getting is {disfmarker} is something else . </s> PhD A : Uh - huh . </s> Professor B : And so , uh , Stephane 's idea was , uh , let 's feed , uh , both this discriminatively trained thing and something that 's not . So you have a good set of features that everybody 's worked really hard to make , </s> PhD A : Yeah . </s> Professor B : and then , uh , you {disfmarker} you discriminately train it , but you also take the path that {disfmarker} that doesn't have that , </s> PhD A : Uh - huh . </s> Professor B : and putting those in together . And that {disfmarker} that seem So it 's kind of like a combination of the {disfmarker} uh , what , uh , Dan has been calling , you know , a feature {disfmarker} uh , you know , a feature combination versus posterior combination or something . It 's {disfmarker} it 's , you know , you have the posterior combination but then you get the features from that and use them as a feature combination with these {disfmarker} these other things . And that seemed , at least in the last one , as he was just saying , he {disfmarker} he {disfmarker} when he only did discriminative stuff , i it actually was {disfmarker} was {disfmarker} it didn't help at all in this particular case . </s> PhD A : Yeah . </s> Professor B : There was enough of a difference , I guess , between the testing and training . But by having them both there {disfmarker} The fact is some of the time , the discriminative stuff is gonna help you . </s> PhD A : Mm - hmm . </s> Professor B : And some of the time it 's going to hurt you , </s> PhD A : Right . </s> Professor B : and by combining two information sources if , you know {disfmarker} if {disfmarker} if {disfmarker} </s> PhD A : So you wouldn't necessarily then want to do LDA on the non - tandem features because now you 're doing something to them that {disfmarker} </s> Professor B : That i i I think that 's counter to that idea . </s> PhD A : Yeah , right . </s> Professor B : Now , again , it 's {disfmarker} we 're just trying these different things . We don't really know what 's gonna work best . But if that 's the hypothesis , at least it would be counter to that hypothesis to do that . </s> PhD A : Right . </s> Professor B : Um , and in principle you would think that the neural net would do better at the discriminant part than LDA . </s> PhD A : Right . Yeah . Well {disfmarker} y </s> Professor B : Though , maybe not . </s> PhD A : Yeah . Exactly . I mean , we , uh {disfmarker} we were getting ready to do the tandem , uh , stuff for the Hub - five system , and , um , Andreas and I talked about it , and the idea w the thought was , \" Well , uh , yeah , that i you know {disfmarker} th the neural net should be better , but we should at least have uh , a number , you know , to show that we did try the LDA in place of the neural net , so that we can you know , show a clear path . </s> Professor B : Right . </s> PhD A : You know , that you have it without it , then you have the LDA , then you have the neural net , and you can see , theoretically . So . I was just wondering {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} </s> Professor B : Well , I think that 's a good idea . </s> PhD A : Yeah . </s> Professor B : Did {disfmarker} did you do that </s> PhD A : Um . No . </s> Professor B : or {disfmarker} tha that 's a {disfmarker} </s> PhD A : That 's what {disfmarker} that 's what we 're gonna do next as soon as I finish this other thing . So . </s> Professor B : Yeah . Yeah . No , well , that 's a good idea . I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} </s> PhD A : We just want to show . </s> Professor B : i Yeah . </s> PhD A : I mean , it {disfmarker} everybody believes it , </s> Professor B : Oh , no it 's a g </s> PhD A : but you know , we just {disfmarker} </s> Professor B : No , no , but it might not {disfmarker} not even be true . </s> PhD A : Yeah . </s> Professor B : I mean , it 's {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} it 's a great idea .

So there 's the {disfmarker} the LDA is {disfmarker} is right there before the H M </s> PhD D : Yeah . </s> PhD A : So , you guys are using LDA but it seems like it 's pretty far back in the process . </s> PhD D : Uh , this LDA is different from the LDA that you are talking about . The LDA that you {disfmarker} saying is , like , you take a block of features , like nine frames or something , {comment} and then do an LDA on it , </s> PhD A : Yeah . Uh - huh . </s> PhD D : and then reduce the dimensionality to something like twenty - four or something like that . </s> PhD A : Yeah , you c you c you can . </s> PhD D : And then feed it to HMM . </s> PhD A : I mean , it 's {disfmarker} you know , you 're just basically i </s> PhD D : Yeah , so this is like a two d two dimensional tile . </s> PhD A : You 're shifting the feature space . Yeah . </s> PhD D : So this is a two dimensional tile . And the LDA that we are f applying is only in time , not in frequency {disfmarker} high cost frequency . So it 's like {disfmarker} more like a filtering in time , rather than doing a r </s> PhD A : Ah . OK . So what i what about , um {disfmarker} i u what i w I mean , I don't know if this is a good idea or not , but what if you put {disfmarker} ran the other kind of LDA , uh , on your features right before they go into the HMM ? </s> PhD D : Uh , it {disfmarker} </s> PhD C : Mm - hmm . No , actually , I think {disfmarker} i </s> PhD D : m </s> PhD C : Well . What do we do with the ANN is {disfmarker} is something like that except that it 's not linear . But it 's {disfmarker} it 's like a nonlinear discriminant analysis . </s> PhD A : Yeah . Right , it 's the {disfmarker} It 's {disfmarker} Right . The {disfmarker} So {disfmarker} Yeah , so it 's sort of like {disfmarker} </s> PhD C : But . </s> PhD A : The tandem stuff is kind of like i nonlinear LDA . </s> PhD C : Yeah . It 's {disfmarker} </s> PhD A : I g </s> PhD C : Yeah . </s> PhD A : Yeah . </s> Professor B : Yeah . </s> PhD A : But I mean , w but the other features that you have , um , th the non - tandem ones , </s> PhD C : Uh . Mm - hmm . Yeah , I know . That {disfmarker} that {disfmarker} Yeah . Well , in the proposal , they were transformed u using PCA , but {disfmarker} </s> PhD A : Uh - huh . </s> PhD C : Yeah , it might be that LDA could be better . </s> Professor B : The a the argument i is kind of i in {disfmarker} and it 's not like we really know , but the argument anyway is that , um , uh , we always have the prob I mean , discriminative things are good . LDA , neural nets , they 're good . </s> PhD A : Yeah . </s> Professor B : Uh , they 're good because you {disfmarker} you {disfmarker} you learn to distinguish between these categories that you want to be good at distinguishing between . And PCA doesn't do that . It {disfmarker} PAC - PCA {disfmarker} low - order PCA throws away pieces that are uh , maybe not {disfmarker} not gonna be helpful just because they 're small , basically . </s> PhD A : Right . </s> Professor B : But , uh , the problem is , training sets aren't perfect and testing sets are different . So you f you {disfmarker} you face the potential problem with discriminative stuff , be it LDA or neural nets , that you are training to discriminate between categories in one space but what you 're really gonna be g getting is {disfmarker} is something else . </s> PhD A : Uh - huh . </s> Professor B : And so , uh , Stephane 's idea was , uh , let 's feed , uh , both this discriminatively trained thing and something that 's not . So you have a good set of features that everybody 's worked really hard to make , </s> PhD A : Yeah . </s> Professor B : and then , uh , you {disfmarker} you discriminately train it , but you also take the path that {disfmarker} that doesn't have that , </s> PhD A : Uh - huh . </s> Professor B : and putting those in together . And that {disfmarker} that seem So it 's kind of like a combination of the {disfmarker} uh , what , uh , Dan has been calling , you know , a feature {disfmarker} uh , you know , a feature combination versus posterior combination or something . It 's {disfmarker} it 's , you know , you have the posterior combination but then you get the features from that and use them as a feature combination with these {disfmarker} these other things . And that seemed , at least in the last one , as he was just saying , he {disfmarker} he {disfmarker} when he only did discriminative stuff , i it actually was {disfmarker} was {disfmarker} it didn't help at all in this particular case . </s> PhD A : Yeah . </s> Professor B : There was enough of a difference , I guess , between the testing and training . But by having them both there {disfmarker} The fact is some of the time , the discriminative stuff is gonna help you . </s> PhD A : Mm - hmm . </s> Professor B : And some of the time it 's going to hurt you , </s> PhD A : Right . </s> Professor B : and by combining two information sources if , you know {disfmarker} if {disfmarker} if {disfmarker} </s> PhD A : So you wouldn't necessarily then want to do LDA on the non - tandem features because now you 're doing something to them that {disfmarker} </s> Professor B : That i i I think that 's counter to that idea . </s> PhD A : Yeah , right . </s> Professor B : Now , again , it 's {disfmarker} we 're just trying these different things . We don't really know what 's gonna work best . But if that 's the hypothesis , at least it would be counter to that hypothesis to do that . </s> PhD A : Right . </s> Professor B : Um , and in principle you would think that the neural net would do better at the discriminant part than LDA . </s> PhD A : Right . Yeah . Well {disfmarker} y </s> Professor B : Though , maybe not . </s> PhD A : Yeah . Exactly . I mean , we , uh {disfmarker} we were getting ready to do the tandem , uh , stuff for the Hub - five system , and , um , Andreas and I talked about it , and the idea w the thought was , \" Well , uh , yeah , that i you know {disfmarker} th the neural net should be better , but we should at least have uh , a number , you know , to show that we did try the LDA in place of the neural net , so that we can you know , show a clear path . </s> Professor B : Right . </s> PhD A : You know , that you have it without it , then you have the LDA , then you have the neural net , and you can see , theoretically . So . I was just wondering {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} </s> Professor B : Well , I think that 's a good idea . </s> PhD A : Yeah . </s> Professor B : Did {disfmarker} did you do that </s> PhD A : Um . No . </s> Professor B : or {disfmarker} tha that 's a {disfmarker} </s> PhD A : That 's what {disfmarker} that 's what we 're gonna do next as soon as I finish this other thing .

I mean , one of the things that always disturbed me , uh , in the {disfmarker} the resurgence of neural nets that happened in the eighties was that , um , a lot of people {disfmarker} Because neural nets were pretty easy to {disfmarker} to use {disfmarker} a lot of people were just using them for all sorts of things without , uh , looking at all into the linear , uh {disfmarker} uh , versions of them . </s> PhD A : Yeah . Mm - hmm . Yeah . </s> Professor B : And , uh , people were doing recurrent nets but not looking at IIR filters , and {disfmarker} You know , I mean , uh , so I think , yeah , it 's definitely a good idea to try it . </s> PhD A : Yeah , and everybody 's putting that on their {vocalsound} systems now , and so , I that 's what made me wonder about this , </s> Professor B : Well , they 've been putting them in their systems off and on for ten years , </s> PhD A : but . </s> Professor B : but {disfmarker} but {disfmarker} but , uh , </s> PhD A : Yeah , what I mean is it 's {disfmarker} it 's like in the Hub - five evaluations , you know , and you read the system descriptions and everybody 's got , {vocalsound} you know , LDA on their features . </s> Professor B : And now they all have that . I see . </s> PhD A : And so . </s> Professor B : Yeah . </s> PhD A : Uh . </s> PhD C : It 's the transformation they 're estimating on {disfmarker} Well , they are trained on the same data as the final HMM are . </s> PhD A : Yeah , so it 's different . Yeah , exactly . Cuz they don't have these , you know , mismatches that {disfmarker} that you guys have . </s> PhD C : Mm - hmm . </s> PhD A : So that 's why I was wondering if maybe it 's not even a good idea . </s> PhD C : Mm - hmm . </s> PhD A : I don't know .

When you {disfmarker} in {disfmarker} in the old experiments when you ran with the neural net only , and didn't have this side path , um , uh , with the {disfmarker} the pure features as well , did it make things better to have the neural net ? </s> PhD C : Mm - hmm . </s> Professor B : Was it about the same ?

It 's {disfmarker} it 's pretty different . Isn't it ? </s> PhD C : Uh , there is a car noise . So there are f just four noises . Um , uh , \" Car \" , I think , \" Babble \" , </s> PhD D : \" Babble . \" </s> PhD C : \" Subway \" , right ? and {disfmarker} </s> PhD D : \" Street \" or \" Airport \" or something . </s> PhD C : and {disfmarker} \" Street \" isn't {disfmarker} </s> PhD D : Or \" Train station \" . </s> PhD C : \" Train station \" , yeah . </s> PhD D : Yeah . </s> PhD C : So {disfmarker} it 's mostly {disfmarker} Well , \" Car \" is stationary , </s> Professor B : Mm - hmm . </s> PhD C : \" Babble \" , it 's a stationary background plus some voices , </s> Professor B : Mm - hmm . </s> PhD C : some speech over it . And the other two are rather stationary also . </s> Professor B : Well , I {disfmarker} I think that if you run it {disfmarker} Actually , you {disfmarker} maybe you remember this . When you {disfmarker} in {disfmarker} in the old experiments when you ran with the neural net only , and didn't have this side path , um , uh , with the {disfmarker} the pure features as well , did it make things better to have the neural net ? </s> PhD C : Mm - hmm . </s> Professor B : Was it about the same ? Uh , w i </s> PhD C : It was {disfmarker} b a little bit worse . </s> Professor B : Than {disfmarker} ? </s> PhD C : Than just the features , yeah . </s> Professor B : So , until you put the second path in with the pure features , the neural net wasn't helping at all . </s> PhD C : Mm - hmm . </s> Professor B : Well , that 's interesting . </s> PhD C : It was helping , uh , if the features are b were bad , </s> Professor B : Yeah . </s> PhD C : I mean . Just plain P L Ps or M F </s> Professor B : Yeah . </s> PhD C : C Cs . as soon as we added LDA on - line normalization , and {vocalsound} all these things , then {disfmarker} </s> Professor B : They were doing similar enough things . Well , I still think it would be k sort of interesting to see what would happen if you just had the neural net without the side thing . </s> PhD C : Yeah , </s> Professor B : And {disfmarker} and the thing I {disfmarker} I have in mind is , uh , maybe you 'll see that the results are not just a little bit worse . </s> PhD C : mm - hmm . </s> Professor B : Maybe that they 're a lot worse . You know ? And , um {disfmarker} But if on the ha other hand , uh , it 's , say , somewhere in between what you 're seeing now and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and , uh , what you 'd have with just the pure features , then maybe there is some problem of a {disfmarker} of a , uh , combination of these things , or correlation between them somehow . </s> PhD C : Mm - hmm . </s> Professor B : If it really is that the net is hurting you at the moment , then I think the issue is to focus on {disfmarker} on , uh , improving the {disfmarker} the net . </s> PhD C : Yeah , </s> Professor B : Um . </s> PhD C : mm - hmm . </s> Professor B : So what 's the overall effe I mean , you haven't done all the experiments but you said it was i somewhat better , say , five percent better , for the first two conditions , and fifteen percent worse for the other one ? But it 's {disfmarker} but of course that one 's weighted lower , </s> PhD C : Y yeah , oh . Yeah . </s> Professor B : so I wonder what the net effect is . </s> PhD C : I d I {disfmarker} I think it 's {disfmarker} it was one or two percent . That 's not that bad , but it was l like two percent relative worse on SpeechDat - Car . I have to {disfmarker} to check that . Well , I have {disfmarker} I will . </s> PhD D : Well , it will {disfmarker} overall it will be still better even if it is fifteen percent worse , because the fifteen percent worse is given like f w twenty - five {disfmarker} point two five eight . </s> Professor B : Right . </s> PhD C : Mm - hmm . Hmm . </s> Professor B : Right . So the {disfmarker} so the worst it could be , if the others were exactly the same , is four , </s> PhD D : Is it like {disfmarker} </s> Professor B : and {disfmarker} and , uh , in fact since the others are somewhat better {disfmarker} </s> PhD D : Yeah , so it 's four . Is i So either it 'll get cancelled out , or you 'll get , like , almost the same . </s> Professor B : Uh . </s> PhD C : Yeah , it was {disfmarker} it was slightly worse . </s> PhD D : Slightly bad . Yeah . </s> PhD C : Um , </s> Professor B : Yeah , it should be pretty close to cancelled out . </s> PhD D : Yeah . </s> PhD A : You know , I 've been wondering about something . </s> PhD C : Mm - hmm . </s> PhD A : In the , um {disfmarker} a lot of the , um {disfmarker} the Hub - five systems , um , recently have been using LDA . and {disfmarker} and they , um {disfmarker} They run LDA on the features right before they train the models . So there 's the {disfmarker} the LDA is {disfmarker} is right there before the H M </s> PhD D : Yeah . </s> PhD A : So , you guys are using LDA but it seems like it 's pretty far back in the process . </s> PhD D : Uh , this LDA is different from the LDA that you are talking about . The LDA that you {disfmarker} saying is , like , you take a block of features , like nine frames or something , {comment} and then do an LDA on it , </s> PhD A : Yeah . Uh - huh . </s> PhD D : and then reduce the dimensionality to something like twenty - four or something like that . </s> PhD A : Yeah , you c you c you can . </s> PhD D : And then feed it to HMM . </s> PhD A : I mean , it 's {disfmarker} you know , you 're just basically i </s> PhD D : Yeah , so this is like a two d two dimensional tile . </s> PhD A : You 're shifting the feature space . Yeah . </s> PhD D : So this is a two dimensional tile . And the LDA that we are f applying is only in time , not in frequency {disfmarker} high cost frequency . So it 's like {disfmarker} more like a filtering in time , rather than doing a r </s> PhD A : Ah . OK . So what i what about , um {disfmarker} i u what i w I mean , I don't know if this is a good idea or not , but what if you put {disfmarker} ran the other kind of LDA , uh , on your features right before they go into the HMM ? </s> PhD D : Uh , it {disfmarker} </s> PhD C : Mm - hmm . No , actually , I think {disfmarker} i </s> PhD D : m </s> PhD C : Well . What do we do with the ANN is {disfmarker} is something like that except that it 's not linear . But it 's {disfmarker} it 's like a nonlinear discriminant analysis . </s> PhD A : Yeah . Right , it 's the {disfmarker} It 's {disfmarker} Right . The {disfmarker} So {disfmarker} Yeah , so it 's sort of like {disfmarker} </s> PhD C : But . </s> PhD A : The tandem stuff is kind of like i nonlinear LDA . </s> PhD C : Yeah . It 's {disfmarker} </s> PhD A : I g </s> PhD C : Yeah . </s> PhD A : Yeah . </s> Professor B : Yeah . </s> PhD A : But I mean , w but the other features that you have , um , th the non - tandem ones , </s> PhD C : Uh . Mm - hmm . Yeah , I know . That {disfmarker} that {disfmarker} Yeah . Well , in the proposal , they were transformed u using PCA , but {disfmarker} </s> PhD A : Uh - huh . </s> PhD C : Yeah , it might be that LDA could be better . </s> Professor B : The a the argument i is kind of i in {disfmarker} and it 's not like we really know , but the argument anyway is that , um , uh , we always have the prob I mean , discriminative things are good . LDA , neural nets , they 're good . </s> PhD A : Yeah . </s> Professor B : Uh , they 're good because you {disfmarker} you {disfmarker} you learn to distinguish between these categories that you want to be good at distinguishing between . And PCA doesn't do that . It {disfmarker} PAC - PCA {disfmarker} low - order PCA throws away pieces that are uh , maybe not {disfmarker} not gonna be helpful just because they 're small , basically . </s> PhD A : Right . </s> Professor B : But , uh , the problem is , training sets aren't perfect and testing sets are different . So you f you {disfmarker} you face the potential problem with discriminative stuff , be it LDA or neural nets , that you are training to discriminate between categories in one space but what you 're really gonna be g getting is {disfmarker} is something else . </s> PhD A : Uh - huh . </s> Professor B : And so , uh , Stephane 's idea was , uh , let 's feed , uh , both this discriminatively trained thing and something that 's not . So you have a good set of features that everybody 's worked really hard to make , </s> PhD A : Yeah . </s> Professor B : and then , uh , you {disfmarker} you discriminately train it , but you also take the path that {disfmarker} that doesn't have that , </s> PhD A : Uh - huh . </s> Professor B : and putting those in together . And that {disfmarker} that seem So it 's kind of like a combination of the {disfmarker} uh , what , uh , Dan has been calling , you know , a feature {disfmarker} uh , you know , a feature combination versus posterior combination or something . It 's {disfmarker} it 's , you know , you have the posterior combination but then you get the features from that and use them as a feature combination with these {disfmarker} these other things . And that seemed , at least in the last one , as he was just saying , he {disfmarker} he {disfmarker} when he only did discriminative stuff , i it actually was {disfmarker} was {disfmarker} it didn't help at all in this particular case . </s> PhD A : Yeah . </s> Professor B : There was enough of a difference , I guess , between the testing and training . But by having them both there {disfmarker} The fact is some of the time , the discriminative stuff is gonna help you . </s> PhD A : Mm - hmm . </s> Professor B : And some of the time it 's going to hurt you , </s> PhD A : Right . </s> Professor B : and by combining two information sources if , you know {disfmarker} if {disfmarker} if {disfmarker} </s> PhD A : So you wouldn't necessarily then want to do LDA on the non - tandem features because now you 're doing something to them that {disfmarker} </s> Professor B : That i i I think that 's counter to that idea . </s> PhD A : Yeah , right . </s> Professor B : Now , again , it 's {disfmarker} we 're just trying these different things . We don't really know what 's gonna work best . But if that 's the hypothesis , at least it would be counter to that hypothesis to do that . </s> PhD A : Right . </s> Professor B : Um , and in principle you would think that the neural net would do better at the discriminant part than LDA . </s> PhD A : Right . Yeah . Well {disfmarker} y </s> Professor B : Though , maybe not . </s> PhD A : Yeah . Exactly . I mean , we , uh {disfmarker} we were getting ready to do the tandem , uh , stuff for the Hub - five system , and , um , Andreas and I talked about it , and the idea w the thought was , \" Well , uh , yeah , that i you know {disfmarker} th the neural net should be better , but we should at least have uh , a number , you know , to show that we did try the LDA in place of the neural net , so that we can you know , show a clear path . </s> Professor B : Right . </s> PhD A : You know , that you have it without it , then you have the LDA , then you have the neural net , and you can see , theoretically . So . I was just wondering {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} </s> Professor B : Well , I think that 's a good idea . </s> PhD A : Yeah . </s> Professor B : Did {disfmarker} did you do that </s> PhD A : Um . No . </s> Professor B : or {disfmarker} tha that 's a {disfmarker} </s> PhD A : That 's what {disfmarker} that 's what we 're gonna do next as soon as I finish this other thing . So . </s> Professor B : Yeah . Yeah . No , well , that 's a good idea . I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} </s> PhD A : We just want to show . </s> Professor B : i Yeah . </s> PhD A : I mean , it {disfmarker} everybody believes it , </s> Professor B : Oh , no it 's a g </s> PhD A : but you know , we just {disfmarker} </s> Professor B : No , no , but it might not {disfmarker} not even be true . </s> PhD A : Yeah . </s> Professor B : I mean , it 's {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} it 's a great idea . I mean , one of the things that always disturbed me , uh , in the {disfmarker} the resurgence of neural nets that happened in the eighties was that , um , a lot of people {disfmarker} Because neural nets were pretty easy to {disfmarker} to use {disfmarker} a lot of people were just using them for all sorts of things without , uh , looking at all into the linear , uh {disfmarker} uh , versions of them . </s> PhD A : Yeah . Mm - hmm . Yeah . </s> Professor B : And , uh , people were doing recurrent nets but not looking at IIR filters , and {disfmarker} You know , I mean , uh , so I think , yeah , it 's definitely a good idea to try it . </s> PhD A : Yeah , and everybody 's putting that on their {vocalsound} systems now , and so , I that 's what made me wonder about this , </s> Professor B : Well , they 've been putting them in their systems off and on for ten years , </s> PhD A : but . </s> Professor B : but {disfmarker} but {disfmarker} but , uh , </s> PhD A : Yeah , what I mean is it 's {disfmarker} it 's like in the Hub - five evaluations , you know , and you read the system descriptions and everybody 's got , {vocalsound} you know , LDA on their features . </s> Professor B : And now they all have that . I see . </s> PhD A : And so . </s> Professor B : Yeah . </s> PhD A : Uh . </s> PhD C : It 's the transformation they 're estimating on {disfmarker} Well , they are trained on the same data as the final HMM are . </s> PhD A : Yeah , so it 's different . Yeah , exactly . Cuz they don't have these , you know , mismatches that {disfmarker} that you guys have . </s> PhD C : Mm - hmm . </s> PhD A : So that 's why I was wondering if maybe it 's not even a good idea . </s> PhD C : Mm - hmm . </s> PhD A : I don't know . I {disfmarker} I don't know enough about it , </s> PhD C : Mm - hmm . </s> PhD A : but {disfmarker} Um . </s> Professor B : I mean , part of why {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I think part of why you were getting into the KLT {disfmarker} Y you were describing to me at one point that you wanted to see if , uh , you know , getting good orthogonal features was {disfmarker} and combining the {disfmarker} the different temporal ranges {disfmarker} was the key thing that was happening or whether it was this discriminant thing , right ? So you were just trying {disfmarker} I think you r I mean , this is {disfmarker} it doesn't have the LDA aspect but th as far as the orthogonalizing transformation , you were trying that at one point , right ? </s> PhD C : Mm - hmm . </s> Professor B : I think you were . </s> PhD C : Mm - hmm . Yeah . </s> Professor B : Does something . It doesn't work as well . Yeah . Yeah .",

Um , uh , \" Car \" , I think , \" Babble \" , </s> PhD D : \" Babble . \" </s> PhD C : \" Subway \" , right ? and {disfmarker} </s> PhD D : \" Street \" or \" Airport \" or something . </s> PhD C : and {disfmarker} \" Street \" isn't {disfmarker} </s> PhD D : Or \" Train station \" . </s> PhD C : \" Train station \" , yeah . </s> PhD D : Yeah . </s> PhD C : So {disfmarker} it 's mostly {disfmarker} Well , \" Car \" is stationary , </s> Professor B : Mm - hmm . </s> PhD C : \" Babble \" , it 's a stationary background plus some voices , </s> Professor B : Mm - hmm . </s> PhD C : some speech over it . And the other two are rather stationary also . </s> Professor B : Well , I {disfmarker} I think that if you run it {disfmarker} Actually , you {disfmarker} maybe you remember this . When you {disfmarker} in {disfmarker} in the old experiments when you ran with the neural net only , and didn't have this side path , um , uh , with the {disfmarker} the pure features as well , did it make things better to have the neural net ? </s> PhD C : Mm - hmm . </s> Professor B : Was it about the same ? Uh , w i </s> PhD C : It was {disfmarker} b a little bit worse . </s> Professor B : Than {disfmarker} ? </s> PhD C : Than just the features , yeah . </s> Professor B : So , until you put the second path in with the pure features , the neural net wasn't helping at all . </s> PhD C : Mm - hmm . </s> Professor B : Well , that 's interesting . </s> PhD C : It was helping , uh , if the features are b were bad , </s> Professor B : Yeah . </s> PhD C : I mean . Just plain P L Ps or M F </s> Professor B : Yeah . </s> PhD C : C Cs . as soon as we added LDA on - line normalization , and {vocalsound} all these things , then {disfmarker} </s> Professor B : They were doing similar enough things . Well , I still think it would be k sort of interesting to see what would happen if you just had the neural net without the side thing . </s> PhD C : Yeah , </s> Professor B : And {disfmarker} and the thing I {disfmarker} I have in mind is , uh , maybe you 'll see that the results are not just a little bit worse . </s> PhD C : mm - hmm . </s> Professor B : Maybe that they 're a lot worse . You know ? And , um {disfmarker} But if on the ha other hand , uh , it 's , say , somewhere in between what you 're seeing now and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and , uh , what you 'd have with just the pure features , then maybe there is some problem of a {disfmarker} of a , uh , combination of these things , or correlation between them somehow . </s> PhD C : Mm - hmm . </s> Professor B : If it really is that the net is hurting you at the moment , then I think the issue is to focus on {disfmarker} on , uh , improving the {disfmarker} the net . </s> PhD C : Yeah , </s> Professor B : Um . </s> PhD C : mm - hmm . </s> Professor B : So what 's the overall effe I mean , you haven't done all the experiments but you said it was i somewhat better , say , five percent better , for the first two conditions , and fifteen percent worse for the other one ? But it 's {disfmarker} but of course that one 's weighted lower , </s> PhD C : Y yeah , oh . Yeah . </s> Professor B : so I wonder what the net effect is . </s> PhD C : I d I {disfmarker} I think it 's {disfmarker} it was one or two percent . That 's not that bad , but it was l like two percent relative worse on SpeechDat - Car . I have to {disfmarker} to check that . Well , I have {disfmarker} I will . </s> PhD D : Well , it will {disfmarker} overall it will be still better even if it is fifteen percent worse , because the fifteen percent worse is given like f w twenty - five {disfmarker} point two five eight . </s> Professor B : Right . </s> PhD C : Mm - hmm . Hmm . </s> Professor B : Right . So the {disfmarker} so the worst it could be , if the others were exactly the same , is four , </s> PhD D : Is it like {disfmarker} </s> Professor B : and {disfmarker} and , uh , in fact since the others are somewhat better {disfmarker} </s> PhD D : Yeah , so it 's four . Is i So either it 'll get cancelled out , or you 'll get , like , almost the same . </s> Professor B : Uh . </s> PhD C : Yeah , it was {disfmarker} it was slightly worse . </s> PhD D : Slightly bad . Yeah . </s> PhD C : Um , </s> Professor B : Yeah , it should be pretty close to cancelled out . </s> PhD D : Yeah . </s> PhD A : You know , I 've been wondering about something . </s> PhD C : Mm - hmm . </s> PhD A : In the , um {disfmarker} a lot of the , um {disfmarker} the Hub - five systems , um , recently have been using LDA . and {disfmarker} and they , um {disfmarker} They run LDA on the features right before they train the models . So there 's the {disfmarker} the LDA is {disfmarker} is right there before the H M </s> PhD D : Yeah . </s> PhD A : So , you guys are using LDA but it seems like it 's pretty far back in the process . </s> PhD D : Uh , this LDA is different from the LDA that you are talking about . The LDA that you {disfmarker} saying is , like , you take a block of features , like nine frames or something , {comment} and then do an LDA on it , </s> PhD A : Yeah . Uh - huh . </s> PhD D : and then reduce the dimensionality to something like twenty - four or something like that . </s> PhD A : Yeah , you c you c you can . </s> PhD D : And then feed it to HMM . </s> PhD A : I mean , it 's {disfmarker} you know , you 're just basically i </s> PhD D : Yeah , so this is like a two d two dimensional tile . </s> PhD A : You 're shifting the feature space . Yeah . </s> PhD D : So this is a two dimensional tile . And the LDA that we are f applying is only in time , not in frequency {disfmarker} high cost frequency . So it 's like {disfmarker} more like a filtering in time , rather than doing a r </s> PhD A : Ah . OK . So what i what about , um {disfmarker} i u what i w I mean , I don't know if this is a good idea or not , but what if you put {disfmarker} ran the other kind of LDA , uh , on your features right before they go into the HMM ? </s> PhD D : Uh , it {disfmarker} </s> PhD C : Mm - hmm . No , actually , I think {disfmarker} i </s> PhD D : m </s> PhD C : Well . What do we do with the ANN is {disfmarker} is something like that except that it 's not linear . But it 's {disfmarker} it 's like a nonlinear discriminant analysis . </s> PhD A : Yeah . Right , it 's the {disfmarker} It 's {disfmarker} Right . The {disfmarker} So {disfmarker} Yeah , so it 's sort of like {disfmarker} </s> PhD C : But . </s> PhD A : The tandem stuff is kind of like i nonlinear LDA . </s> PhD C : Yeah . It 's {disfmarker} </s> PhD A : I g </s> PhD C : Yeah . </s> PhD A : Yeah . </s> Professor B : Yeah . </s> PhD A : But I mean , w but the other features that you have , um , th the non - tandem ones , </s> PhD C : Uh . Mm - hmm . Yeah , I know . That {disfmarker} that {disfmarker} Yeah . Well , in the proposal , they were transformed u using PCA , but {disfmarker} </s> PhD A : Uh - huh . </s> PhD C : Yeah , it might be that LDA could be better . </s> Professor B : The a the argument i is kind of i in {disfmarker} and it 's not like we really know , but the argument anyway is that , um , uh , we always have the prob I mean , discriminative things are good . LDA , neural nets , they 're good . </s> PhD A : Yeah . </s> Professor B : Uh , they 're good because you {disfmarker} you {disfmarker} you learn to distinguish between these categories that you want to be good at distinguishing between . And PCA doesn't do that . It {disfmarker} PAC - PCA {disfmarker} low - order PCA throws away pieces that are uh , maybe not {disfmarker} not gonna be helpful just because they 're small , basically . </s> PhD A : Right . </s> Professor B : But , uh , the problem is , training sets aren't perfect and testing sets are different . So you f you {disfmarker} you face the potential problem with discriminative stuff , be it LDA or neural nets , that you are training to discriminate between categories in one space but what you 're really gonna be g getting is {disfmarker} is something else . </s> PhD A : Uh - huh . </s> Professor B : And so , uh , Stephane 's idea was , uh , let 's feed , uh , both this discriminatively trained thing and something that 's not . So you have a good set of features that everybody 's worked really hard to make , </s> PhD A : Yeah . </s> Professor B : and then , uh , you {disfmarker} you discriminately train it , but you also take the path that {disfmarker} that doesn't have that , </s> PhD A : Uh - huh . </s> Professor B : and putting those in together . And that {disfmarker} that seem So it 's kind of like a combination of the {disfmarker} uh , what , uh , Dan has been calling , you know , a feature {disfmarker} uh , you know , a feature combination versus posterior combination or something . It 's {disfmarker} it 's , you know , you have the posterior combination but then you get the features from that and use them as a feature combination with these {disfmarker} these other things . And that seemed , at least in the last one , as he was just saying , he {disfmarker} he {disfmarker} when he only did discriminative stuff , i it actually was {disfmarker} was {disfmarker} it didn't help at all in this particular case . </s> PhD A : Yeah . </s> Professor B : There was enough of a difference , I guess , between the testing and training . But by having them both there {disfmarker} The fact is some of the time , the discriminative stuff is gonna help you . </s> PhD A : Mm - hmm . </s> Professor B : And some of the time it 's going to hurt you , </s> PhD A : Right . </s> Professor B : and by combining two information sources if , you know {disfmarker} if {disfmarker} if {disfmarker} </s> PhD A : So you wouldn't necessarily then want to do LDA on the non - tandem features because now you 're doing something to them that {disfmarker} </s> Professor B : That i i I think that 's counter to that idea . </s> PhD A : Yeah , right . </s> Professor B : Now , again , it 's {disfmarker} we 're just trying these different things . We don't really know what 's gonna work best . But if that 's the hypothesis , at least it would be counter to that hypothesis to do that . </s> PhD A : Right . </s> Professor B : Um , and in principle you would think that the neural net would do better at the discriminant part than LDA . </s> PhD A : Right . Yeah . Well {disfmarker} y </s> Professor B : Though , maybe not . </s> PhD A : Yeah . Exactly . I mean , we , uh {disfmarker} we were getting ready to do the tandem , uh , stuff for the Hub - five system , and , um , Andreas and I talked about it , and the idea w the thought was , \" Well , uh , yeah , that i you know {disfmarker} th the neural net should be better , but we should at least have uh , a number , you know , to show that we did try the LDA in place of the neural net , so that we can you know , show a clear path . </s> Professor B : Right . </s> PhD A : You know , that you have it without it , then you have the LDA , then you have the neural net , and you can see , theoretically . So . I was just wondering {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} </s> Professor B : Well , I think that 's a good idea . </s> PhD A : Yeah . </s> Professor B : Did {disfmarker} did you do that </s> PhD A : Um . No . </s> Professor B : or {disfmarker} tha that 's a {disfmarker} </s> PhD A : That 's what {disfmarker} that 's what we 're gonna do next as soon as I finish this other thing . So . </s> Professor B : Yeah . Yeah . No , well , that 's a good idea . I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} </s> PhD A : We just want to show . </s> Professor B : i Yeah . </s> PhD A : I mean , it {disfmarker} everybody believes it , </s> Professor B : Oh , no it 's a g </s> PhD A : but you know , we just {disfmarker} </s> Professor B : No , no , but it might not {disfmarker} not even be true . </s> PhD A : Yeah . </s> Professor B : I mean , it 's {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} it 's a great idea . I mean , one of the things that always disturbed me , uh , in the {disfmarker} the resurgence of neural nets that happened in the eighties was that , um , a lot of people {disfmarker} Because neural nets were pretty easy to {disfmarker} to use {disfmarker} a lot of people were just using them for all sorts of things without , uh , looking at all into the linear , uh {disfmarker} uh , versions of them . </s> PhD A : Yeah . Mm - hmm . Yeah . </s> Professor B : And , uh , people were doing recurrent nets but not looking at IIR filters , and {disfmarker} You know , I mean , uh , so I think , yeah , it 's definitely a good idea to try it . </s> PhD A : Yeah , and everybody 's putting that on their {vocalsound} systems now , and so , I that 's what made me wonder about this , </s> Professor B : Well , they 've been putting them in their systems off and on for ten years , </s> PhD A : but . </s> Professor B : but {disfmarker} but {disfmarker} but , uh , </s> PhD A : Yeah , what I mean is it 's {disfmarker} it 's like in the Hub - five evaluations , you know , and you read the system descriptions and everybody 's got , {vocalsound} you know , LDA on their features . </s> Professor B : And now they all have that . I see . </s> PhD A : And so . </s> Professor B : Yeah . </s> PhD A : Uh . </s> PhD C : It 's the transformation they 're estimating on {disfmarker} Well , they are trained on the same data as the final HMM are . </s> PhD A : Yeah , so it 's different . Yeah , exactly . Cuz they don't have these , you know , mismatches that {disfmarker} that you guys have . </s> PhD C : Mm - hmm . </s> PhD A : So that 's why I was wondering if maybe it 's not even a good idea . </s> PhD C : Mm - hmm . </s> PhD A : I don't know . I {disfmarker} I don't know enough about it , </s> PhD C : Mm - hmm . </s> PhD A : but {disfmarker} Um . </s> Professor B : I mean , part of why {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I think part of why you were getting into the KLT {disfmarker} Y you were describing to me at one point that you wanted to see if , uh , you know , getting good orthogonal features was {disfmarker} and combining the {disfmarker} the different temporal ranges {disfmarker} was the key thing that was happening or whether it was this discriminant thing , right ? So you were just trying {disfmarker} I think you r I mean , this is {disfmarker} it doesn't have the LDA aspect but th as far as the orthogonalizing transformation , you were trying that at one point , right ? </s> PhD C : Mm - hmm . </s> Professor B : I think you were . </s> PhD C : Mm - hmm .

When you {disfmarker} in {disfmarker} in the old experiments when you ran with the neural net only , and didn't have this side path , um , uh , with the {disfmarker} the pure features as well , did it make things better to have the neural net ? </s> PhD C : Mm - hmm . </s> Professor B : Was it about the same ?

You know ? And , um {disfmarker} But if on the ha other hand , uh , it 's , say , somewhere in between what you 're seeing now and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and , uh , what you 'd have with just the pure features , then maybe there is some problem of a {disfmarker} of a , uh , combination of these things , or correlation between them somehow . </s> PhD C : Mm - hmm . </s> Professor B : If it really is that the net is hurting you at the moment , then I think the issue is to focus on {disfmarker} on , uh , improving the {disfmarker} the net . </s> PhD C : Yeah , </s> Professor B : Um . </s> PhD C : mm - hmm . </s> Professor B : So what 's the overall effe I mean , you haven't done all the experiments but you said it was i somewhat better , say , five percent better , for the first two conditions , and fifteen percent worse for the other one ?

Yeah . </s> Professor B : so I wonder what the net effect is . </s> PhD C : I d I {disfmarker} I think it 's {disfmarker} it was one or two percent . That 's not that bad , but it was l like two percent relative worse on SpeechDat - Car . I have to {disfmarker} to check that . Well , I have {disfmarker} I will . </s> PhD D : Well , it will {disfmarker} overall it will be still better even if it is fifteen percent worse , because the fifteen percent worse is given like f w twenty - five {disfmarker} point two five eight . </s> Professor B : Right . </s> PhD C : Mm - hmm . Hmm . </s> Professor B : Right . So the {disfmarker} so the worst it could be , if the others were exactly the same , is four , </s> PhD D : Is it like {disfmarker} </s> Professor B : and {disfmarker} and , uh , in fact since the others are somewhat better {disfmarker} </s> PhD D : Yeah , so it 's four .

Yeah . </s> PhD C : Um , </s> Professor B : Yeah , it should be pretty close to cancelled out . </s> PhD D : Yeah . </s> PhD A : You know , I 've been wondering about something . </s> PhD C : Mm - hmm . </s> PhD A : In the , um {disfmarker} a lot of the , um {disfmarker} the Hub - five systems , um , recently have been using LDA . and {disfmarker} and they , um {disfmarker} They run LDA on the features right before they train the models . So there 's the {disfmarker} the LDA is {disfmarker} is right there before the H M </s> PhD D : Yeah . </s> PhD A : So , you guys are using LDA but it seems like it 's pretty far back in the process . </s> PhD D : Uh , this LDA is different from the LDA that you are talking about . The LDA that you {disfmarker} saying is , like , you take a block of features , like nine frames or something , {comment} and then do an LDA on it , </s> PhD A : Yeah . Uh - huh . </s> PhD D : and then reduce the dimensionality to something like twenty - four or something like that . </s> PhD A : Yeah , you c you c you can . </s> PhD D : And then feed it to HMM . </s> PhD A : I mean , it 's {disfmarker} you know , you 're just basically i </s> PhD D : Yeah , so this is like a two d two dimensional tile . </s> PhD A : You 're shifting the feature space . Yeah . </s> PhD D : So this is a two dimensional tile . And the LDA that we are f applying is only in time , not in frequency {disfmarker} high cost frequency . So it 's like {disfmarker} more like a filtering in time , rather than doing a r </s> PhD A : Ah . OK . So what i what about , um {disfmarker} i u what i w I mean , I don't know if this is a good idea or not , but what if you put {disfmarker} ran the other kind of LDA , uh , on your features right before they go into the HMM ? </s> PhD D : Uh , it {disfmarker} </s> PhD C : Mm - hmm . No , actually , I think {disfmarker} i </s> PhD D : m </s> PhD C : Well . What do we do with the ANN is {disfmarker} is something like that except that it 's not linear . But it 's {disfmarker} it 's like a nonlinear discriminant analysis . </s> PhD A : Yeah . Right , it 's the {disfmarker} It 's {disfmarker} Right . The {disfmarker} So {disfmarker} Yeah , so it 's sort of like {disfmarker} </s> PhD C : But . </s> PhD A : The tandem stuff is kind of like i nonlinear LDA . </s> PhD C : Yeah . It 's {disfmarker} </s> PhD A : I g </s> PhD C : Yeah . </s> PhD A : Yeah . </s> Professor B : Yeah . </s> PhD A : But I mean , w but the other features that you have , um , th the non - tandem ones , </s> PhD C : Uh . Mm - hmm . Yeah , I know . That {disfmarker} that {disfmarker} Yeah . Well , in the proposal , they were transformed u using PCA , but {disfmarker} </s> PhD A : Uh - huh . </s> PhD C : Yeah , it might be that LDA could be better . </s> Professor B : The a the argument i is kind of i in {disfmarker} and it 's not like we really know , but the argument anyway is that , um , uh , we always have the prob I mean , discriminative things are good . LDA , neural nets , they 're good . </s> PhD A : Yeah . </s> Professor B : Uh , they 're good because you {disfmarker} you {disfmarker} you learn to distinguish between these categories that you want to be good at distinguishing between . And PCA doesn't do that . It {disfmarker} PAC - PCA {disfmarker} low - order PCA throws away pieces that are uh , maybe not {disfmarker} not gonna be helpful just because they 're small , basically . </s> PhD A : Right . </s> Professor B : But , uh , the problem is , training sets aren't perfect and testing sets are different . So you f you {disfmarker} you face the potential problem with discriminative stuff , be it LDA or neural nets , that you are training to discriminate between categories in one space but what you 're really gonna be g getting is {disfmarker} is something else . </s> PhD A : Uh - huh . </s> Professor B : And so , uh , Stephane 's idea was , uh , let 's feed , uh , both this discriminatively trained thing and something that 's not . So you have a good set of features that everybody 's worked really hard to make , </s> PhD A : Yeah . </s> Professor B : and then , uh , you {disfmarker} you discriminately train it , but you also take the path that {disfmarker} that doesn't have that , </s> PhD A : Uh - huh . </s> Professor B : and putting those in together . And that {disfmarker} that seem So it 's kind of like a combination of the {disfmarker} uh , what , uh , Dan has been calling , you know , a feature {disfmarker} uh , you know , a feature combination versus posterior combination or something . It 's {disfmarker} it 's , you know , you have the posterior combination but then you get the features from that and use them as a feature combination with these {disfmarker} these other things . And that seemed , at least in the last one , as he was just saying , he {disfmarker} he {disfmarker} when he only did discriminative stuff , i it actually was {disfmarker} was {disfmarker} it didn't help at all in this particular case . </s> PhD A : Yeah . </s> Professor B : There was enough of a difference , I guess , between the testing and training . But by having them both there {disfmarker} The fact is some of the time , the discriminative stuff is gonna help you . </s> PhD A : Mm - hmm . </s> Professor B : And some of the time it 's going to hurt you , </s> PhD A : Right . </s> Professor B : and by combining two information sources if , you know {disfmarker} if {disfmarker} if {disfmarker} </s> PhD A : So you wouldn't necessarily then want to do LDA on the non - tandem features because now you 're doing something to them that {disfmarker} </s> Professor B : That i i I think that 's counter to that idea . </s> PhD A : Yeah , right . </s> Professor B : Now , again , it 's {disfmarker} we 're just trying these different things . We don't really know what 's gonna work best . But if that 's the hypothesis , at least it would be counter to that hypothesis to do that . </s> PhD A : Right . </s> Professor B : Um , and in principle you would think that the neural net would do better at the discriminant part than LDA . </s> PhD A : Right .

You know , you can have integers and you can have doubles , and all that sort of stuff . </s> PhD F : So that {disfmarker} that sounds {disfmarker} that sounds about what I w </s> Grad C : Um . Right ? And it has a header {disfmarker} it has a header format that {pause} describes it {pause} to some extent .

So you could imagine that uh the remote control will be standing up straight in the docking station . This is not really {disfmarker} This is pretty much a new shape to uh older people . So they would prefer uh a design where the remote control just lies flat in the docking station . So it would be kinda more telephone-shaped . Um besides that we would advise um to bring two editions , one with a wood-like colour and maybe feel , and one with a grey-black colour . The wood-like for the more uh exclusive people .

Okay , we go on to the next one . </s> User Interface : {gap} </s> Project Manager : {vocalsound} </s> User Interface : Um {vocalsound} 'kay um yeah . {gap} uh some uh research uh a about um designing of an interface . Um the uh last meeting uh we had a about um uh using a f few buttons . So uh um uh that's w what I what I want to uh uh to do in uh our design . So um finding an attractive uh way to control uh the remote control . Um the uh {disfmarker} I found some uh something about uh speech uh recognition . So maybe uh we can uh use uh that . Um {disfmarker} Uh and uh using a little uh display . So um findings . Um yeah just um we have just to focus on the primary um functions . So uh only uh buttons uh for uh sound , um for uh on-off , um uh shifting u up uh sa uh ca channel or uh down shifting down . Um uh let's see . Um yeah and {disfmarker} Uh {gap} we uh need some uh new a attractive functions uh uh which attract uh uh people for using it . So uh it's uh like a speak uh speech uh recognition and um a special button for selecting uh subtitles . Just uh what we uh mentioned uh last uh meeting . Um and yeah overall um user-friendly . So uh using uh large large buttons . Um {disfmarker} It's uh possible to uh uh to make um quite cheap uh system for uh speech uh recognition . Um you can think about um uh when you lost your um remote control , you can uh call it and um it gives an um sig signal . So uh uh yeah . And and uh for uh shifting up a sen uh c ch channel or uh for um uh putting out uh sound or something , you can uh just give a sign uh say um sound off or {disfmarker} A and uh yeah . Television uh put the sound off uh put the sound off uh . Um {disfmarker} Let's see . Uh yeah . I was thinking about the special uh button for uh subtitles , um just one button to keep it uh simple . Uh one push on the button uh you get uh uh small uh subtitles . Um double push push um , if double click , um so uh you get uh big uh subtitles , for uh people uh um uh which c f uh who can't uh read small uh subtitles . So uh {disfmarker} Um {disfmarker} Yeah and w we have to keep uh in general buttons uh so um we've got um the buttons we have to use . The on-off , sound on-off , sound higher or lower , um the numbers , uh zero to uh uh nine . Um the general buttons m more general b one button for shifting up and shifting down uh channel . Um also we want to uh use a little d display uh for um for displaying the uh the functions of the buttons . And um we can uh build in a function f which uh shows the channel or some uh which the t television is on . So um made a little uh picture of uh it . Um {disfmarker} See . Um yeah . Just um we can put uh the on-off button uh over in this uh corner , um almost uh e all uh remote controls uh are using a on-off button on that place . Um so uh people uh will uh recognise uh um the button . </s> Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} </s> User Interface : So um {disfmarker} D display uh of it , it's uh just a small display . Uh um you can put it uh on top . Um it's uh most uh uh place where people uh , most of {gap} looks at . So uh um and a special uh button for shifting up uh and uh shifting down uh channel , um it's uh on place where um the thumb of of the {disfmarker} So you you can uh easily uh shift up or shift down . Um it's uh quite uh handy place . So um and uh all the f functions for subtitle uh one button , uh for sound uh {disfmarker} Uh and uh for our design , um uh we have to discuss about it uh I think uh so uh the form of it so {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : Okay . </s> User Interface : And that's it . </s> Project Manager : Uh thank you . {vocalsound} </s> Industrial Designer : Okay . About the components design . Um for the energy source we can use a basic battery or , a as an optional thing , a kinetic energy , like in a watch , which you just shake and it produces energy . But if we choose for that option , the docking station would c become obsolete . So I don't think it's really an option . Uh for the casing , uh the uh manufacturing department can deliver uh a flat casing , single or double curved casing . It's really up the the design that we're gonna use . It's uh doesn't uh imply any technical restrictions . Uh as a case supplement , we could um , I thought of that l later , uh a rubber uh belt , like a anti-slip . Uh for the b buttons , we can use plastic or rubber . And the chip-set , um it says simple here , but it should be advanced , because we're using an L_C_D_ uh screen .

Just , um , I guess , let me put it in context . OK , so we 're talking about discovering intermediate categories to , um {disfmarker} to classify . And , uh , I was looking at some of the work that , uh , Sangita was doing on these TRAPS things . So she has , um {disfmarker} she has temporal patterns for , um , a certain set of phonemes , from {disfmarker} from TIMIT , right ? the most common phonemes . And each one of them has {disfmarker} has a {disfmarker} a nice pattern over time , a one {disfmarker} one second window . And it has {disfmarker} has these patterns . Um , so she has , um a TRAP for each one of the phonemes , um , times fifteen , for each of the fifteen critical bands . And , um , {vocalsound} she does this agglomerative hierarchical clustering which {disfmarker} which basically , um , is a clustering algorithm that , uh , starts with many , many , many different points {disfmarker} many different clusters {disfmarker} uh , corresponding to the number of data , uh , patterns that you have in the data . And then you have this distance mej metric which , uh , measures how {disfmarker} how closely related they are . And you start , um {vocalsound} by merging the patterns that are most closely related . </s> PhD E : And you create a tree . </s> Grad C : And y yeah , yeah , a dendrogram tree . </s> PhD E : Mm - hmm . </s> Grad C : Um . </s> PhD E : And then you can pick , uh , values anywhere along that tree to fix your set of clusters . </s> Grad C : Right , usually it 's when , um {disfmarker} when the sol similarity measures , um , don't go down as much . </s> PhD E : Mm - hmm . </s> Grad C : And so , uh {disfmarker} so you stop at that point . And what she found was , sh um , was there were five broad , um {disfmarker} broad categories , uh , corresponding to , uh , things like , uh , fricatives and , uh , vocalic , um , and , uh , stops . </s> Professor B : Mm - hmm . </s> Grad C : And , uh , one for silence and {disfmarker} and another one for schwa {disfmarker} schwa sounds . Um , and , um , I was thinking about ways to {disfmarker} to generalize this because w you 're {disfmarker} it 's sort of like a {disfmarker} it 's not a completely automatic way of clustering , because yo beforehand you have these {disfmarker} these TRAPS and you 're saying that {disfmarker} that these frames correspond to this particular phoneme . Um , and that 's {disfmarker} that 's constraining your {disfmarker} your clustering to {disfmarker} to the set of phonemes that you already have . Um , whereas maybe we want to just take {disfmarker} take a look at , um , arbitrary windows in time , um , of varying length , um , and cluster those . </s> PhD E : Mm - hmm . </s> Grad C : And I 'm thinking if we {disfmarker} if we do that , then we would probably , um , at some point in the clustering algorithm find that we 've clustered things like , OK , thi this is a transition , um , this is a relatively stable {disfmarker} stable point . </s> PhD E : Mm - hmm . </s> Grad C : Um , and I 'm hoping to find other things of {disfmarker} of similarity and maybe use these things as the intermediate , um {disfmarker} intermediate categories that , uh , um , I 'll later classify . </s> PhD E : Mm - hmm . </s> Professor B : Are you looking at these in narrow bands ? </s> Grad C : Um , right . F um , I 'm {disfmarker} </s> Professor B : Cuz that 's what you 're gonna be using , right ? </s> Grad C : Yeah , yeah . I {disfmarker} I haven't exactly figured out , um , the exact details for that but , uh , the {disfmarker} the representation of the data that I was thinking of , was using , um , critical band , um , energies , {vocalsound} um , over different lengths of time . So {disfmarker} Yeah . </s> Professor B : Yeah , I mean , it seems somehow that needs th uh , there 's a couple things that I wonder about with this . I mean , so one is {disfmarker} is , {pause} again , looking at the same representation , </s> Grad C : OK . </s> Professor B : I mean , if you 're going for this sort of thing where you have {pause} uh , little detectors that are looking at narrow bands , then what you 're going to be looking for should be some category that you can find with the narrow bands . </s> Grad C : Mm - hmm . </s> Professor B : That {disfmarker} that seems to be kind of fundamental to it . Um , and then the other thing , uh , is {disfmarker} that I wonder about with it , and {disfmarker} and don't take this in the wrong way , like I {disfmarker} I know what I 'm doing or anything , </s> Grad C : Right . </s> Professor B : but , I mean . {vocalsound} Um , just wondering really . </s> Grad C : Mm - hmm . </s> Professor B : Um , the sort of standard answer about this sort of thing is that if you 're trying to find {pause} the right system in some sense , whether you 're trying by categories or {disfmarker} or parameters {pause} um , and your goal is discrimination , then having choices based on discrimination as opposed to , um , unsupervised nearness of things , um , is actually better . </s> Grad C : Hmm . </s> Professor B : Um , and I don't know if that {disfmarker} I mean , since you 're dealing with issues of robustness , you know , maybe {disfmarker} maybe this isn't right , but it 'd be something I 'd be concerned about . Because , for instance , you can imagine , uh , uh , i i if you remember from {disfmarker} from , uh {disfmarker} from your {disfmarker} your quals , John Ohala saying that , uh , \" buh \" {comment} and \" puh \" {comment} differed , uh , not really cuz of voicing but because of aspiration . I mean , in as far as wha what 's really there in the acoustics . </s> Grad C : Mm - hmm . </s> Professor B : So , um , if you looked {disfmarker} if you were doing some coarse clustering , you probably would put those two sounds together . And yet , I would gue I would guess that many of your recognition errors were coming from , uh , um , pfft , {comment} screwing up on this distinction . </s> Grad C : Mm - hmm . </s> Professor B : So , in fact , it 's a little hard because recognizers , to first order , sort of work . And the reasons we 're doing the things we 're doing is because they don't work as well as we 'd like . And since they sort of work , uh , it means that they are already doing {disfmarker} if you go and take any recognizer that 's already out there and you say , \" how well is it distinguishing between {pause} schwas and stops ? \" </s> Grad C : Mm - hmm . </s> Professor B : Boy , I bet they 're all doing nearly perfectly on this , right ? </s> Grad C : Mm - hmm . </s> Professor B : So these {disfmarker} these big categories that differ in huge obvious ways , we already know how to do . So , what are we bringing to the party ? I mean , in fact what we wanna do is have something that , particularly in the presence of noise , uh , is better at distinguishing between , uh , categories that are actually close to one another , and hence , would probably be clustered together . </s> Grad C : Mmm . </s> Professor B : So that 's th that 's the hard thing . I mean , I understand that there 's this other constraint that you 're considering , is that you wanna have categories that , uh {disfmarker} that would be straightforward for , say , a human being to mark if you had manual annotation . And it 's something that you really think you can pick up . But I think it 's also essential that you wanna look at what are the {vocalsound} confusions that you 're making and how can you come up with , uh , categories that , uh , can clarify these confusions . </s> Grad C : Mm - hmm . Hmm . </s> Professor B : So , I mean , the standard sort of way of doing that is take a look at the algorithms you 're looking at , but then throw in some discriminative aspect to it .  Y y this is more like , you know , how does LDA differ from PCA ? I mean , they 're the same sort of thing . They 're both orthogonalizing . </s> Grad C : Right . </s> Professor B : But , you know {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and , um , this is a little harder because you 're not just trying to find parameters . You 're actually trying to find the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the categories themselves . Uh , so a little more like brain surgery , I think on yourself . Uh . So , uh </s> Grad C : Yeah . </s> Professor B : Um , anyway . That 's my {pause} thought . </s> Grad C : OK . </s> Professor B : You 've been thinking about this problem for a long time actually . I mean , well {disfmarker} W actually , you stopped thinking about it for a long time , but you used to think about it {vocalsound} a lot . </s> PhD E : Yeah . </s> Professor B : And you 've been thinking about it more now , </s> PhD D : Yeah . </s> Professor B : these categories . </s> PhD E : Yeah . </s> Professor B : Mm - hmm . </s> PhD E : I guess {disfmarker} I don't {disfmarker} I don't {disfmarker} um , it 's not clear to me how to reconcile , you know , what you 're saying , which I think is right , with {pause} the way I 've been looking at it . That it 's {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} it 's all not very clear to me . But it seems to me that the desire {disfmarker} the desirable feature to have is something that , um , is bottom - up . You know , however we do that . </s> Professor B : Mm - hmm . </s> PhD E : And and so I guess what I don't understand is how to do that and still be discriminative , because to be discriminative you have to have categories and the only categories that we know of to use are sort of these human {disfmarker} human sig significant {disfmarker} categories that are significant to humans , like phonemes , things like that . </s> Professor B : Right . </s> PhD E : But that 's sort of what you want to avoid .

    "article": "Professor B : OK . Uh . Got anything to tell us ? </s> Grad C : Um . Well , I 've been reading some literature about clustering of data . Just , um , I guess , let me put it in context . OK , so we 're talking about discovering intermediate categories to , um {disfmarker} to classify . And , uh , I was looking at some of the work that , uh , Sangita was doing on these TRAPS things . So she has , um {disfmarker} she has temporal patterns for , um , a certain set of phonemes , from {disfmarker} from TIMIT , right ? the most common phonemes . And each one of them has {disfmarker} has a {disfmarker} a nice pattern over time , a one {disfmarker} one second window . And it has {disfmarker} has these patterns . Um , so she has , um a TRAP for each one of the phonemes , um , times fifteen , for each of the fifteen critical bands . And , um , {vocalsound} she does this agglomerative hierarchical clustering which {disfmarker} which basically , um , is a clustering algorithm that , uh , starts with many , many , many different points {disfmarker} many different clusters {disfmarker} uh , corresponding to the number of data , uh , patterns that you have in the data . And then you have this distance mej metric which , uh , measures how {disfmarker} how closely related they are . And you start , um {vocalsound} by merging the patterns that are most closely related . </s> PhD E : And you create a tree . </s> Grad C : And y yeah , yeah , a dendrogram tree . </s> PhD E : Mm - hmm . </s> Grad C : Um . </s> PhD E : And then you can pick , uh , values anywhere along that tree to fix your set of clusters . </s> Grad C : Right , usually it 's when , um {disfmarker} when the sol similarity measures , um , don't go down as much . </s> PhD E : Mm - hmm . </s> Grad C : And so , uh {disfmarker} so you stop at that point . And what she found was , sh um , was there were five broad , um {disfmarker} broad categories , uh , corresponding to , uh , things like , uh , fricatives and , uh , vocalic , um , and , uh , stops . </s> Professor B : Mm - hmm . </s> Grad C : And , uh , one for silence and {disfmarker} and another one for schwa {disfmarker} schwa sounds . Um , and , um , I was thinking about ways to {disfmarker} to generalize this because w you 're {disfmarker} it 's sort of like a {disfmarker} it 's not a completely automatic way of clustering , because yo beforehand you have these {disfmarker} these TRAPS and you 're saying that {disfmarker} that these frames correspond to this particular phoneme . Um , and that 's {disfmarker} that 's constraining your {disfmarker} your clustering to {disfmarker} to the set of phonemes that you already have . Um , whereas maybe we want to just take {disfmarker} take a look at , um , arbitrary windows in time , um , of varying length , um , and cluster those . </s> PhD E : Mm - hmm . </s> Grad C : And I 'm thinking if we {disfmarker} if we do that , then we would probably , um , at some point in the clustering algorithm find that we 've clustered things like , OK , thi this is a transition , um , this is a relatively stable {disfmarker} stable point . </s> PhD E : Mm - hmm . </s> Grad C : Um , and I 'm hoping to find other things of {disfmarker} of similarity and maybe use these things as the intermediate , um {disfmarker} intermediate categories that , uh , um , I 'll later classify . </s> PhD E : Mm - hmm . </s> Professor B : Are you looking at these in narrow bands ? </s> Grad C : Um , right . F um , I 'm {disfmarker} </s> Professor B : Cuz that 's what you 're gonna be using , right ? </s> Grad C : Yeah , yeah . I {disfmarker} I haven't exactly figured out , um , the exact details for that but , uh , the {disfmarker} the representation of the data that I was thinking of , was using , um , critical band , um , energies , {vocalsound} um , over different lengths of time . So {disfmarker} Yeah . </s> Professor B : Yeah , I mean , it seems somehow that needs th uh , there 's a couple things that I wonder about with this . I mean , so one is {disfmarker} is , {pause} again , looking at the same representation , </s> Grad C : OK . </s> Professor B : I mean , if you 're going for this sort of thing where you have {pause} uh , little detectors that are looking at narrow bands , then what you 're going to be looking for should be some category that you can find with the narrow bands . </s> Grad C : Mm - hmm . </s> Professor B : That {disfmarker} that seems to be kind of fundamental to it . Um , and then the other thing , uh , is {disfmarker} that I wonder about with it , and {disfmarker} and don't take this in the wrong way , like I {disfmarker} I know what I 'm doing or anything , </s> Grad C : Right . </s> Professor B : but , I mean . {vocalsound} Um , just wondering really . </s> Grad C : Mm - hmm . </s> Professor B : Um , the sort of standard answer about this sort of thing is that if you 're trying to find {pause} the right system in some sense , whether you 're trying by categories or {disfmarker} or parameters {pause} um , and your goal is discrimination , then having choices based on discrimination as opposed to , um , unsupervised nearness of things , um , is actually better . </s> Grad C : Hmm . </s> Professor B : Um , and I don't know if that {disfmarker} I mean , since you 're dealing with issues of robustness , you know , maybe {disfmarker} maybe this isn't right , but it 'd be something I 'd be concerned about . Because , for instance , you can imagine , uh , uh , i i if you remember from {disfmarker} from , uh {disfmarker} from your {disfmarker} your quals , John Ohala saying that , uh , \" buh \" {comment} and \" puh \" {comment} differed , uh , not really cuz of voicing but because of aspiration . I mean , in as far as wha what 's really there in the acoustics . </s> Grad C : Mm - hmm . </s> Professor B : So , um , if you looked {disfmarker} if you were doing some coarse clustering , you probably would put those two sounds together . And yet , I would gue I would guess that many of your recognition errors were coming from , uh , um , pfft , {comment} screwing up on this distinction . </s> Grad C : Mm - hmm . </s> Professor B : So , in fact , it 's a little hard because recognizers , to first order , sort of work . And the reasons we 're doing the things we 're doing is because they don't work as well as we 'd like . And since they sort of work , uh , it means that they are already doing {disfmarker} if you go and take any recognizer that 's already out there and you say , \" how well is it distinguishing between {pause} schwas and stops ? \" </s> Grad C : Mm - hmm . </s> Professor B : Boy , I bet they 're all doing nearly perfectly on this , right ? </s> Grad C : Mm - hmm . </s> Professor B : So these {disfmarker} these big categories that differ in huge obvious ways , we already know how to do . So , what are we bringing to the party ? I mean , in fact what we wanna do is have something that , particularly in the presence of noise , uh , is better at distinguishing between , uh , categories that are actually close to one another , and hence , would probably be clustered together . </s> Grad C : Mmm . </s> Professor B : So that 's th that 's the hard thing . I mean , I understand that there 's this other constraint that you 're considering , is that you wanna have categories that , uh {disfmarker} that would be straightforward for , say , a human being to mark if you had manual annotation . And it 's something that you really think you can pick up . But I think it 's also essential that you wanna look at what are the {vocalsound} confusions that you 're making and how can you come up with , uh , categories that , uh , can clarify these confusions . </s> Grad C : Mm - hmm . Hmm . </s> Professor B : So , I mean , the standard sort of way of doing that is take a look at the algorithms you 're looking at , but then throw in some discriminative aspect to it .  Y y this is more like , you know , how does LDA differ from PCA ? I mean , they 're the same sort of thing . They 're both orthogonalizing . </s> Grad C : Right . </s> Professor B : But , you know {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and , um , this is a little harder because you 're not just trying to find parameters . You 're actually trying to find the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the categories themselves . Uh , so a little more like brain surgery , I think on yourself . Uh . So , uh </s> Grad C : Yeah . </s> Professor B : Um , anyway . That 's my {pause} thought . </s> Grad C : OK . </s> Professor B : You 've been thinking about this problem for a long time actually . I mean , well {disfmarker} W actually , you stopped thinking about it for a long time , but you used to think about it {vocalsound} a lot . </s> PhD E : Yeah . </s> Professor B : And you 've been thinking about it more now , </s> PhD D : Yeah . </s> Professor B : these categories . </s> PhD E : Yeah . </s> Professor B : Mm - hmm . </s> PhD E : I guess {disfmarker} I don't {disfmarker} I don't {disfmarker} um , it 's not clear to me how to reconcile , you know , what you 're saying , which I think is right , with {pause} the way I 've been looking at it . That it 's {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} it 's all not very clear to me . But it seems to me that the desire {disfmarker} the desirable feature to have is something that , um , is bottom - up . You know , however we do that . </s> Professor B : Mm - hmm . </s> PhD E : And and so I guess what I don't understand is how to do that and still be discriminative , because to be discriminative you have to have categories and the only categories that we know of to use are sort of these human {disfmarker} human sig significant {disfmarker} categories that are significant to humans , like phonemes , things like that . </s> Professor B : Right . </s> PhD E : But that 's sort of what you want to avoid . And so that feels {disfmarker} I don't know how to get out of this . </s> Professor B : Well , here 's a {disfmarker} here 's a , uh , uh Here 's a generic and possibly useless thought , which is , {vocalsound} um , what do you really {disfmarker} I mean , in a sense the only s s systems that make sense , uh , are ones that {disfmarker} that have something from top - down in th in them .

And , uh , I was looking at some of the work that , uh , Sangita was doing on these TRAPS things . So she has , um {disfmarker} she has temporal patterns for , um , a certain set of phonemes , from {disfmarker} from TIMIT , right ? the most common phonemes .

And , um , {vocalsound} she does this agglomerative hierarchical clustering which {disfmarker} which basically , um , is a clustering algorithm that , uh , starts with many , many , many different points {disfmarker} many different clusters {disfmarker} uh , corresponding to the number of data , uh , patterns that you have in the data .

And what she found was , sh um , was there were five broad , um {disfmarker} broad categories , uh , corresponding to , uh , things like , uh , fricatives and , uh , vocalic , um , and , uh , stops . </s> Professor B : Mm - hmm . </s> Grad C : And , uh , one for silence and {disfmarker} and another one for schwa {disfmarker} schwa sounds . Um , and , um , I was thinking about ways to {disfmarker} to generalize this because w you 're {disfmarker} it 's sort of like a {disfmarker} it 's not a completely automatic way of clustering , because yo beforehand you have these {disfmarker} these TRAPS and you 're saying that {disfmarker} that these frames correspond to this particular phoneme . Um , and that 's {disfmarker} that 's constraining your {disfmarker} your clustering to {disfmarker} to the set of phonemes that you already have . Um , whereas maybe we want to just take {disfmarker} take a look at , um , arbitrary windows in time , um , of varying length , um , and cluster those . </s> PhD E : Mm - hmm . </s> Grad C : And I 'm thinking if we {disfmarker} if we do that , then we would probably , um , at some point in the clustering algorithm find that we 've clustered things like , OK , thi this is a transition , um , this is a relatively stable {disfmarker} stable point . </s> PhD E : Mm - hmm . </s> Grad C : Um , and I 'm hoping to find other things of {disfmarker} of similarity and maybe use these things as the intermediate , um {disfmarker} intermediate categories that , uh , um , I 'll later classify . </s> PhD E : Mm - hmm . </s> Professor B : Are you looking at these in narrow bands ? </s> Grad C : Um , right . F um , I 'm {disfmarker} </s> Professor B : Cuz that 's what you 're gonna be using , right ? </s> Grad C : Yeah , yeah . I {disfmarker} I haven't exactly figured out , um , the exact details for that but , uh , the {disfmarker} the representation of the data that I was thinking of , was using , um , critical band , um , energies , {vocalsound} um , over different lengths of time . So {disfmarker} Yeah . </s> Professor B : Yeah , I mean , it seems somehow that needs th uh , there 's a couple things that I wonder about with this .

Um , and then the other thing , uh , is {disfmarker} that I wonder about with it , and {disfmarker} and don't take this in the wrong way , like I {disfmarker} I know what I 'm doing or anything , </s> Grad C : Right . </s> Professor B : but , I mean . {vocalsound} Um , just wondering really . </s> Grad C : Mm - hmm . </s> Professor B : Um , the sort of standard answer about this sort of thing is that if you 're trying to find {pause} the right system in some sense , whether you 're trying by categories or {disfmarker} or parameters {pause} um , and your goal is discrimination , then having choices based on discrimination as opposed to , um , unsupervised nearness of things , um , is actually better . </s> Grad C : Hmm . </s> Professor B : Um , and I don't know if that {disfmarker} I mean , since you 're dealing with issues of robustness , you know , maybe {disfmarker} maybe this isn't right , but it 'd be something I 'd be concerned about . Because , for instance , you can imagine , uh , uh , i i if you remember from {disfmarker} from , uh {disfmarker} from your {disfmarker} your quals , John Ohala saying that , uh , \" buh \" {comment} and \" puh \" {comment} differed , uh , not really cuz of voicing but because of aspiration . I mean , in as far as wha what 's really there in the acoustics . </s> Grad C : Mm - hmm . </s> Professor B : So , um , if you looked {disfmarker} if you were doing some coarse clustering , you probably would put those two sounds together . And yet , I would gue I would guess that many of your recognition errors were coming from , uh , um , pfft , {comment} screwing up on this distinction . </s> Grad C : Mm - hmm . </s> Professor B : So , in fact , it 's a little hard because recognizers , to first order , sort of work . And the reasons we 're doing the things we 're doing is because they don't work as well as we 'd like . And since they sort of work , uh , it means that they are already doing {disfmarker} if you go and take any recognizer that 's already out there and you say , \" how well is it distinguishing between {pause} schwas and stops ? \" </s> Grad C : Mm - hmm . </s> Professor B : Boy , I bet they 're all doing nearly perfectly on this , right ? </s> Grad C : Mm - hmm . </s> Professor B : So these {disfmarker} these big categories that differ in huge obvious ways , we already know how to do . So , what are we bringing to the party ? I mean , in fact what we wanna do is have something that , particularly in the presence of noise , uh , is better at distinguishing between , uh , categories that are actually close to one another , and hence , would probably be clustered together . </s> Grad C : Mmm . </s> Professor B : So that 's th that 's the hard thing . I mean , I understand that there 's this other constraint that you 're considering , is that you wanna have categories that , uh {disfmarker} that would be straightforward for , say , a human being to mark if you had manual annotation . And it 's something that you really think you can pick up . But I think it 's also essential that you wanna look at what are the {vocalsound} confusions that you 're making and how can you come up with , uh , categories that , uh , can clarify these confusions . </s> Grad C : Mm - hmm . Hmm . </s> Professor B : So , I mean , the standard sort of way of doing that is take a look at the algorithms you 're looking at , but then throw in some discriminative aspect to it .  Y y this is more like , you know , how does LDA differ from PCA ? I mean , they 're the same sort of thing . They 're both orthogonalizing . </s> Grad C : Right . </s> Professor B : But , you know {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and , um , this is a little harder because you 're not just trying to find parameters . You 're actually trying to find the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the categories themselves . Uh , so a little more like brain surgery , I think on yourself . Uh . So , uh </s> Grad C : Yeah . </s> Professor B : Um , anyway . That 's my {pause} thought . </s> Grad C : OK . </s> Professor B : You 've been thinking about this problem for a long time actually . I mean , well {disfmarker} W actually , you stopped thinking about it for a long time , but you used to think about it {vocalsound} a lot . </s> PhD E : Yeah . </s> Professor B : And you 've been thinking about it more now , </s> PhD D : Yeah . </s> Professor B : these categories . </s> PhD E : Yeah . </s> Professor B : Mm - hmm . </s> PhD E : I guess {disfmarker} I don't {disfmarker} I don't {disfmarker} um , it 's not clear to me how to reconcile , you know , what you 're saying , which I think is right , with {pause} the way I 've been looking at it . That it 's {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} it 's all not very clear to me . But it seems to me that the desire {disfmarker} the desirable feature to have is something that , um , is bottom - up . You know , however we do that . </s> Professor B : Mm - hmm . </s> PhD E : And and so I guess what I don't understand is how to do that and still be discriminative , because to be discriminative you have to have categories and the only categories that we know of to use are sort of these human {disfmarker} human sig significant {disfmarker} categories that are significant to humans , like phonemes , things like that . </s> Professor B : Right . </s> PhD E : But that 's sort of what you want to avoid . And so that feels {disfmarker} I don't know how to get out of this . </s> Professor B : Well , here 's a {disfmarker} here 's a , uh , uh Here 's a generic and possibly useless thought , which is , {vocalsound} um , what do you really {disfmarker} I mean , in a sense the only s s systems that make sense , uh , are ones that {disfmarker} that have something from top - down in th in them . Right ? Because if e even the smallest organism that 's trying to learn to do anything , if it doesn't have any kind of reward for doing {disfmarker} or penal penalty for doing anything , then it 's just going to behave randomly . </s> PhD E : Mm - hmm . </s> Professor B : So whether you 're talking about something being learned through evolution or being learned through experience , it 's gotta have something come down to it that gives its reward or , you know , at least some reinforcement learning , </s> PhD E : Right . </s> Professor B : right ? </s> PhD E : So the question is , how far down ? </s> Professor B : And </s> PhD E : We could stop at words , but we don't , right ? We go all the way down to phonemes . </s> Professor B : Right , but I me I {disfmarker} I think that maybe in some ways part of the difficulty is {disfmarker} is trying to deal with the {disfmarker} with these phonemes . You know , and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and i it 's almost like you want categories if {disfmarker} if our {disfmarker} if our , uh , um , {vocalsound} metric of {disfmarker} of goodness , uh , i if our {disfmarker} </s> PhD E : Mm - hmm . </s> Professor B : correction {disfmarker} if our metric of badness {vocalsound} is word error rate then , um , maybe we should be looking at words . </s> PhD E : Mm - hmm . </s> Professor B : I mean , for {disfmarker} for {disfmarker} for very nice , uh , reasons we 've looked for a while at syllables , and they have a lot of good properties , but i i i if you go all the way to words , I mean , that 's really {disfmarker} I mean , d w In many applications you wanna go further . You wanna go to concepts or something , or have {disfmarker} have {disfmarker} have concepts , actions , this sort of thing . </s> PhD E : Yeah . But words would be a nice {disfmarker} </s> Professor B : But , words aren't bad , yeah . And {disfmarker} and </s> PhD E : Yeah , so the common {disfmarker} right , the common wisdom is you can't do words because there 's too many of them , right ? So you have to have some smaller set that you can use , uh , and {disfmarker} and so everybody goes to phonemes . But the problem is that we {disfmarker} we build models of words in terms of phonemes and these models are {disfmarker} are really cartoon - ish , right ? So when you look at conversational speech , for example , you don't see the phonemes that you {disfmarker} that you have in your word models . </s> Professor B : Yeah . But {disfmarker} but {disfmarker} but we 're not trying for models of words here . See , so her here 's maybe where {disfmarker} If the issue is that we 're trying to come up with , um , some sort of intermediate categories which will then be useful for later stuff , uh , then {pause} maybe it doesn't matter that we can't have enough {disfmarker} </s> PhD E : Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . </s> Professor B : I mean , what you wanna do is {disfmarker} is build up these categories that are {disfmarker} that are best for word recognition . </s> PhD E : Right . Right . </s> Professor B : And {disfmarker} and somehow if that 's built into the loop of what the categories {disfmarker} I mean , we do this every day in this very gross way of {disfmarker} of running o a thousand experiments </s> PhD E :  Right . </s> Professor B : because we have fast computers and picking the thing that has the best word error rate . </s> PhD E : Yeah . </s> Professor B : In some way {disfmarker} I mean , we derive that all the time . In some ways it 's really not {comment} a bad {disfmarker} bad thing to do because it tells you in fact how your adjustments at the very low level affect the {disfmarker} the final goal . </s> PhD E : Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . </s> Professor B : Um , so maybe there 's a way to even put that in in a much more automatic way , </s> PhD E : Right . </s> Professor B : where you take , you know , something about the error at the level of the word or some other {disfmarker} it could be syllable {disfmarker} but in some large unit , </s> PhD E : Uh - huh . </s> Professor B : uh , and uh {disfmarker} yeah , you may not have word models , you have phone models , whatever , but you sort of {pause} don't worry about that , and just somehow feed it back through . </s> PhD E : Mm - hmm . </s> Professor B : You know , so that 's , uh , wh what I called a useless comments because I 'm not really telling you how to do it . But I mean , it 's a {disfmarker} {vocalsound} it 's {disfmarker} it 's , you know {disfmarker} it </s> PhD E : No , but I think the important part in there is that , you know , if you want to be discriminative , you have to have uh , you know , categories . </s> Professor B : Right . </s> PhD E : And I think this {disfmarker} the important categories are the words , and {pause} not the phones . </s> Professor B : Yeah . Yeah . </s> PhD E : Maybe . And so {disfmarker} Right . If you can put the words in to the loop somehow for determining goodness of your sets of clusters {disfmarker} Uh {disfmarker} </s> Professor B : Now , that being said , I think that {disfmarker} that if you have something that is , um {disfmarker} i Once you start dealing with spontaneous speech , all the things you 're saying are {disfmarker} are really true . </s> PhD E : Mm - hmm . </s> Professor B : If you {pause} have read speech that 's been manually annotated , like TIMIT , then , you know , i i you the phones are gonna be right , actually , {vocalsound} for the most part . </s> PhD E : Yeah . Yeah , </s> Professor B : So {disfmarker} so , uh , it doesn't really hurt them to {disfmarker} to do that , to put in discrimination at that level . </s> PhD E : yeah . </s> Professor B : Um , if you go to spontaneous speech then it 's {disfmarker} it 's trickier and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and , uh , the phones are {disfmarker} uh , you know , it 's gonna be based on bad pronunciation models that you have of {disfmarker} </s> PhD E : </s> Professor B : and , um {disfmarker} And it won't allow for the overlapping phenomenon </s> PhD E : Mmm . So it 's almost like there 's this mechanism that we have that , you know , when {disfmarker} when we 're hearing read speech and all the phonemes are there you know , we {disfmarker} we deal with that , but {disfmarker} but when we go to conversational , and then all of a sudden not all the phonemes are there , it doesn't really matter that much to us as humans because we have some kind of mechanism that allows for these word models , whatever those models are , to be {pause} munged , you know , and {disfmarker} and it doesn't really hurt , and I 'm not sure how {disfmarker} {vocalsound} how to build that in . Uh . </s> Professor B : Yeah , I mean , I guess the other thing i is {disfmarker} is to think of a little bit {disfmarker} I mean , we when y when you start looking at these kind of results I think it usually is {disfmarker} is pretty intuitive , but start looking at um , what are the kinds of confusions that you do make , uh , you know , between words if you want or {disfmarker} or {disfmarker} or , uh , even phones in {disfmarker} in {disfmarker} in {disfmarker} in read speech , say , uh , when there is noise . You know , so is it more across place or more across manner ? Or is it cor you know , is it {disfmarker} ? </s> Grad C : Mm - hmm . </s> Professor B : I mean , I know one thing that happens is that you {disfmarker} you {disfmarker} you , uh , you lose the , um , uh , low energy phones . I mean , if there 's added noise then low energy phones {vocalsound} sometimes don't get heard . And if that {disfmarker} if that is {disfmarker} if it {disfmarker} uh , if that turns it into another word or {disfmarker} or different {disfmarker} you know , or another pair of words or something , then it 's more likely to happen . But , um , I don't know , I w I would {disfmarker} I would guess that you 'd {disfmarker} </s> Grad C : Mm - hmm . </s> Professor B : W I don't know . Anyway , that 's {disfmarker} </s> PhD E : I think part of the difficulty is that a l a lot of the robustness that we have is probably coming from a much higher level . </s> Professor B : Mm - hmm . </s> PhD E : You know , we understand the context of the situation when we 're having a conversation .

So it 's almost like there 's this mechanism that we have that , you know , when {disfmarker} when we 're hearing read speech and all the phonemes are there you know , we {disfmarker} we deal with that , but {disfmarker} but when we go to conversational , and then all of a sudden not all the phonemes are there , it doesn't really matter that much to us as humans because we have some kind of mechanism that allows for these word models , whatever those models are , to be {pause} munged , you know , and {disfmarker} and it doesn't really hurt , and I 'm not sure how {disfmarker} {vocalsound} how to build that in . Uh . </s> Professor B : Yeah , I mean , I guess the other thing i is {disfmarker} is to think of a little bit {disfmarker} I mean , we when y when you start looking at these kind of results I think it usually is {disfmarker} is pretty intuitive , but start looking at um , what are the kinds of confusions that you do make , uh , you know , between words if you want or {disfmarker} or {disfmarker} or , uh , even phones in {disfmarker} in {disfmarker} in {disfmarker} in read speech , say , uh , when there is noise .

And if that {disfmarker} if that is {disfmarker} if it {disfmarker} uh , if that turns it into another word or {disfmarker} or different {disfmarker} you know , or another pair of words or something , then it 's more likely to happen .

Anyway , that 's {disfmarker} </s> PhD E : I think part of the difficulty is that a l a lot of the robustness that we have is probably coming from a much higher level . </s> Professor B : Mm - hmm . </s> PhD E : You know , we understand the context of the situation when we 're having a conversation .

We 're {disfmarker} we 're doing some sort of prediction of what {disfmarker} </s> PhD E : Yeah , exactly . </s> Professor B : Oh , sure , that 's really big . </s> Grad C : Yeah . </s> Professor B : Uh , but I mean , even if you do um , uh , diagnostic rhyme test kind of things , you know , where there really isn't an any information like that , uh , people are still better in noise than they {disfmarker} than they are in {disfmarker} in , uh {disfmarker} uh , than the machines are . </s> PhD E : Hmm . </s> Professor B : So , I mean , that 's {disfmarker} i Right . We can't {disfmarker} we can't get it at all without any language models . Language models are there and important but {disfmarker} but , uh {disfmarker} Uh . If we 're not working on that then {vocalsound} we should work on something else and improve it , but {disfmarker} especially if it looks like the potential is there .

Just , um , I guess , let me put it in context . OK , so we 're talking about discovering intermediate categories to , um {disfmarker} to classify . And , uh , I was looking at some of the work that , uh , Sangita was doing on these TRAPS things . So she has , um {disfmarker} she has temporal patterns for , um , a certain set of phonemes , from {disfmarker} from TIMIT , right ? the most common phonemes . And each one of them has {disfmarker} has a {disfmarker} a nice pattern over time , a one {disfmarker} one second window . And it has {disfmarker} has these patterns . Um , so she has , um a TRAP for each one of the phonemes , um , times fifteen , for each of the fifteen critical bands . And , um , {vocalsound} she does this agglomerative hierarchical clustering which {disfmarker} which basically , um , is a clustering algorithm that , uh , starts with many , many , many different points {disfmarker} many different clusters {disfmarker} uh , corresponding to the number of data , uh , patterns that you have in the data . And then you have this distance mej metric which , uh , measures how {disfmarker} how closely related they are . And you start , um {vocalsound} by merging the patterns that are most closely related . </s> PhD E : And you create a tree . </s> Grad C : And y yeah , yeah , a dendrogram tree . </s> PhD E : Mm - hmm . </s> Grad C : Um . </s> PhD E : And then you can pick , uh , values anywhere along that tree to fix your set of clusters . </s> Grad C : Right , usually it 's when , um {disfmarker} when the sol similarity measures , um , don't go down as much . </s> PhD E : Mm - hmm . </s> Grad C : And so , uh {disfmarker} so you stop at that point . And what she found was , sh um , was there were five broad , um {disfmarker} broad categories , uh , corresponding to , uh , things like , uh , fricatives and , uh , vocalic , um , and , uh , stops . </s> Professor B : Mm - hmm . </s> Grad C : And , uh , one for silence and {disfmarker} and another one for schwa {disfmarker} schwa sounds . Um , and , um , I was thinking about ways to {disfmarker} to generalize this because w you 're {disfmarker} it 's sort of like a {disfmarker} it 's not a completely automatic way of clustering , because yo beforehand you have these {disfmarker} these TRAPS and you 're saying that {disfmarker} that these frames correspond to this particular phoneme . Um , and that 's {disfmarker} that 's constraining your {disfmarker} your clustering to {disfmarker} to the set of phonemes that you already have . Um , whereas maybe we want to just take {disfmarker} take a look at , um , arbitrary windows in time , um , of varying length , um , and cluster those . </s> PhD E : Mm - hmm . </s> Grad C : And I 'm thinking if we {disfmarker} if we do that , then we would probably , um , at some point in the clustering algorithm find that we 've clustered things like , OK , thi this is a transition , um , this is a relatively stable {disfmarker} stable point . </s> PhD E : Mm - hmm . </s> Grad C : Um , and I 'm hoping to find other things of {disfmarker} of similarity and maybe use these things as the intermediate , um {disfmarker} intermediate categories that , uh , um , I 'll later classify . </s> PhD E : Mm - hmm . </s> Professor B : Are you looking at these in narrow bands ? </s> Grad C : Um , right .

I {disfmarker} I haven't exactly figured out , um , the exact details for that but , uh , the {disfmarker} the representation of the data that I was thinking of , was using , um , critical band , um , energies , {vocalsound} um , over different lengths of time .

And what she found was , sh um , was there were five broad , um {disfmarker} broad categories , uh , corresponding to , uh , things like , uh , fricatives and , uh , vocalic , um , and , uh , stops . </s> Professor B : Mm - hmm . </s> Grad C : And , uh , one for silence and {disfmarker} and another one for schwa {disfmarker} schwa sounds . Um , and , um , I was thinking about ways to {disfmarker} to generalize this because w you 're {disfmarker} it 's sort of like a {disfmarker} it 's not a completely automatic way of clustering , because yo beforehand you have these {disfmarker} these TRAPS and you 're saying that {disfmarker} that these frames correspond to this particular phoneme . Um , and that 's {disfmarker} that 's constraining your {disfmarker} your clustering to {disfmarker} to the set of phonemes that you already have . Um , whereas maybe we want to just take {disfmarker} take a look at , um , arbitrary windows in time , um , of varying length , um , and cluster those . </s> PhD E : Mm - hmm . </s> Grad C : And I 'm thinking if we {disfmarker} if we do that , then we would probably , um , at some point in the clustering algorithm find that we 've clustered things like , OK , thi this is a transition , um , this is a relatively stable {disfmarker} stable point . </s> PhD E : Mm - hmm . </s> Grad C : Um , and I 'm hoping to find other things of {disfmarker} of similarity and maybe use these things as the intermediate , um {disfmarker} intermediate categories that , uh , um , I 'll later classify . </s> PhD E : Mm - hmm . </s> Professor B : Are you looking at these in narrow bands ? </s> Grad C : Um , right . F um , I 'm {disfmarker} </s> Professor B : Cuz that 's what you 're gonna be using , right ? </s> Grad C : Yeah , yeah . I {disfmarker} I haven't exactly figured out , um , the exact details for that but , uh , the {disfmarker} the representation of the data that I was thinking of , was using , um , critical band , um , energies , {vocalsound} um , over different lengths of time . So {disfmarker} Yeah . </s> Professor B : Yeah , I mean , it seems somehow that needs th uh , there 's a couple things that I wonder about with this . I mean , so one is {disfmarker} is , {pause} again , looking at the same representation , </s> Grad C : OK . </s> Professor B : I mean , if you 're going for this sort of thing where you have {pause} uh , little detectors that are looking at narrow bands , then what you 're going to be looking for should be some category that you can find with the narrow bands . </s> Grad C : Mm - hmm . </s> Professor B : That {disfmarker} that seems to be kind of fundamental to it . Um , and then the other thing , uh , is {disfmarker} that I wonder about with it , and {disfmarker} and don't take this in the wrong way , like I {disfmarker} I know what I 'm doing or anything , </s> Grad C : Right . </s> Professor B : but , I mean . {vocalsound} Um , just wondering really . </s> Grad C : Mm - hmm . </s> Professor B : Um , the sort of standard answer about this sort of thing is that if you 're trying to find {pause} the right system in some sense , whether you 're trying by categories or {disfmarker} or parameters {pause} um , and your goal is discrimination , then having choices based on discrimination as opposed to , um , unsupervised nearness of things , um , is actually better . </s> Grad C : Hmm . </s> Professor B : Um , and I don't know if that {disfmarker} I mean , since you 're dealing with issues of robustness , you know , maybe {disfmarker} maybe this isn't right , but it 'd be something I 'd be concerned about . Because , for instance , you can imagine , uh , uh , i i if you remember from {disfmarker} from , uh {disfmarker} from your {disfmarker} your quals , John Ohala saying that , uh , \" buh \" {comment} and \" puh \" {comment} differed , uh , not really cuz of voicing but because of aspiration . I mean , in as far as wha what 's really there in the acoustics . </s> Grad C : Mm - hmm . </s> Professor B : So , um , if you looked {disfmarker} if you were doing some coarse clustering , you probably would put those two sounds together . And yet , I would gue I would guess that many of your recognition errors were coming from , uh , um , pfft , {comment} screwing up on this distinction . </s> Grad C : Mm - hmm . </s> Professor B : So , in fact , it 's a little hard because recognizers , to first order , sort of work . And the reasons we 're doing the things we 're doing is because they don't work as well as we 'd like . And since they sort of work , uh , it means that they are already doing {disfmarker} if you go and take any recognizer that 's already out there and you say , \" how well is it distinguishing between {pause} schwas and stops ? \" </s> Grad C : Mm - hmm . </s> Professor B : Boy , I bet they 're all doing nearly perfectly on this , right ? </s> Grad C : Mm - hmm . </s> Professor B : So these {disfmarker} these big categories that differ in huge obvious ways , we already know how to do . So , what are we bringing to the party ? I mean , in fact what we wanna do is have something that , particularly in the presence of noise , uh , is better at distinguishing between , uh , categories that are actually close to one another , and hence , would probably be clustered together . </s> Grad C : Mmm . </s> Professor B : So that 's th that 's the hard thing . I mean , I understand that there 's this other constraint that you 're considering , is that you wanna have categories that , uh {disfmarker} that would be straightforward for , say , a human being to mark if you had manual annotation . And it 's something that you really think you can pick up . But I think it 's also essential that you wanna look at what are the {vocalsound} confusions that you 're making and how can you come up with , uh , categories that , uh , can clarify these confusions . </s> Grad C : Mm - hmm . Hmm . </s> Professor B : So , I mean , the standard sort of way of doing that is take a look at the algorithms you 're looking at , but then throw in some discriminative aspect to it .  Y y this is more like , you know , how does LDA differ from PCA ? I mean , they 're the same sort of thing . They 're both orthogonalizing . </s> Grad C : Right . </s> Professor B : But , you know {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and , um , this is a little harder because you 're not just trying to find parameters . You 're actually trying to find the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the categories themselves . Uh , so a little more like brain surgery , I think on yourself . Uh . So , uh </s> Grad C : Yeah . </s> Professor B : Um , anyway . That 's my {pause} thought . </s> Grad C : OK . </s> Professor B : You 've been thinking about this problem for a long time actually . I mean , well {disfmarker} W actually , you stopped thinking about it for a long time , but you used to think about it {vocalsound} a lot . </s> PhD E : Yeah . </s> Professor B : And you 've been thinking about it more now , </s> PhD D : Yeah . </s> Professor B : these categories . </s> PhD E : Yeah . </s> Professor B : Mm - hmm . </s> PhD E : I guess {disfmarker} I don't {disfmarker} I don't {disfmarker} um , it 's not clear to me how to reconcile , you know , what you 're saying , which I think is right , with {pause} the way I 've been looking at it . That it 's {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} it 's all not very clear to me . But it seems to me that the desire {disfmarker} the desirable feature to have is something that , um , is bottom - up . You know , however we do that . </s> Professor B : Mm - hmm . </s> PhD E : And and so I guess what I don't understand is how to do that and still be discriminative , because to be discriminative you have to have categories and the only categories that we know of to use are sort of these human {disfmarker} human sig significant {disfmarker} categories that are significant to humans , like phonemes , things like that . </s> Professor B : Right . </s> PhD E : But that 's sort of what you want to avoid . And so that feels {disfmarker} I don't know how to get out of this . </s> Professor B : Well , here 's a {disfmarker} here 's a , uh , uh Here 's a generic and possibly useless thought , which is , {vocalsound} um , what do you really {disfmarker} I mean , in a sense the only s s systems that make sense , uh , are ones that {disfmarker} that have something from top - down in th in them . Right ? Because if e even the smallest organism that 's trying to learn to do anything , if it doesn't have any kind of reward for doing {disfmarker} or penal penalty for doing anything , then it 's just going to behave randomly . </s> PhD E : Mm - hmm . </s> Professor B : So whether you 're talking about something being learned through evolution or being learned through experience , it 's gotta have something come down to it that gives its reward or , you know , at least some reinforcement learning , </s> PhD E : Right . </s> Professor B : right ? </s> PhD E : So the question is , how far down ? </s> Professor B : And </s> PhD E : We could stop at words , but we don't , right ? We go all the way down to phonemes . </s> Professor B : Right , but I me I {disfmarker} I think that maybe in some ways part of the difficulty is {disfmarker} is trying to deal with the {disfmarker} with these phonemes . You know , and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and i it 's almost like you want categories if {disfmarker} if our {disfmarker} if our , uh , um , {vocalsound} metric of {disfmarker} of goodness , uh , i if our {disfmarker} </s> PhD E : Mm - hmm . </s> Professor B : correction {disfmarker} if our metric of badness {vocalsound} is word error rate then , um , maybe we should be looking at words . </s> PhD E : Mm - hmm . </s> Professor B : I mean , for {disfmarker} for {disfmarker} for very nice , uh , reasons we 've looked for a while at syllables , and they have a lot of good properties , but i i i if you go all the way to words , I mean , that 's really {disfmarker} I mean , d w In many applications you wanna go further . You wanna go to concepts or something , or have {disfmarker} have {disfmarker} have concepts , actions , this sort of thing . </s> PhD E : Yeah . But words would be a nice {disfmarker} </s> Professor B : But , words aren't bad , yeah . And {disfmarker} and </s> PhD E : Yeah , so the common {disfmarker} right , the common wisdom is you can't do words because there 's too many of them , right ? So you have to have some smaller set that you can use , uh , and {disfmarker} and so everybody goes to phonemes . But the problem is that we {disfmarker} we build models of words in terms of phonemes and these models are {disfmarker} are really cartoon - ish , right ? So when you look at conversational speech , for example , you don't see the phonemes that you {disfmarker} that you have in your word models . </s> Professor B : Yeah . But {disfmarker} but {disfmarker} but we 're not trying for models of words here . See , so her here 's maybe where {disfmarker} If the issue is that we 're trying to come up with , um , some sort of intermediate categories which will then be useful for later stuff , uh , then {pause} maybe it doesn't matter that we can't have enough {disfmarker} </s> PhD E : Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . </s> Professor B : I mean , what you wanna do is {disfmarker} is build up these categories that are {disfmarker} that are best for word recognition . </s> PhD E : Right . Right . </s> Professor B : And {disfmarker} and somehow if that 's built into the loop of what the categories {disfmarker} I mean , we do this every day in this very gross way of {disfmarker} of running o a thousand experiments </s> PhD E :  Right . </s> Professor B : because we have fast computers and picking the thing that has the best word error rate . </s> PhD E : Yeah . </s> Professor B : In some way {disfmarker} I mean , we derive that all the time . In some ways it 's really not {comment} a bad {disfmarker} bad thing to do because it tells you in fact how your adjustments at the very low level affect the {disfmarker} the final goal . </s> PhD E : Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . </s> Professor B : Um , so maybe there 's a way to even put that in in a much more automatic way , </s> PhD E : Right . </s> Professor B : where you take , you know , something about the error at the level of the word or some other {disfmarker} it could be syllable {disfmarker} but in some large unit , </s> PhD E : Uh - huh . </s> Professor B : uh , and uh {disfmarker} yeah , you may not have word models , you have phone models , whatever , but you sort of {pause} don't worry about that , and just somehow feed it back through . </s> PhD E : Mm - hmm . </s> Professor B : You know , so that 's , uh , wh what I called a useless comments because I 'm not really telling you how to do it . But I mean , it 's a {disfmarker} {vocalsound} it 's {disfmarker} it 's , you know {disfmarker} it </s> PhD E : No , but I think the important part in there is that , you know , if you want to be discriminative , you have to have uh , you know , categories . </s> Professor B : Right . </s> PhD E : And I think this {disfmarker} the important categories are the words , and {pause} not the phones . </s> Professor B : Yeah . Yeah . </s> PhD E : Maybe . And so {disfmarker} Right . If you can put the words in to the loop somehow for determining goodness of your sets of clusters {disfmarker} Uh {disfmarker} </s> Professor B : Now , that being said , I think that {disfmarker} that if you have something that is , um {disfmarker} i Once you start dealing with spontaneous speech , all the things you 're saying are {disfmarker} are really true . </s> PhD E : Mm - hmm . </s> Professor B : If you {pause} have read speech that 's been manually annotated , like TIMIT , then , you know , i i you the phones are gonna be right , actually , {vocalsound} for the most part . </s> PhD E : Yeah .

We go all the way down to phonemes . </s> Professor B : Right , but I me I {disfmarker} I think that maybe in some ways part of the difficulty is {disfmarker} is trying to deal with the {disfmarker} with these phonemes . You know , and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and i it 's almost like you want categories if {disfmarker} if our {disfmarker} if our , uh , um , {vocalsound} metric of {disfmarker} of goodness , uh , i if our {disfmarker} </s> PhD E : Mm - hmm . </s> Professor B : correction {disfmarker} if our metric of badness {vocalsound} is word error rate then , um , maybe we should be looking at words . </s> PhD E : Mm - hmm . </s> Professor B : I mean , for {disfmarker} for {disfmarker} for very nice , uh , reasons we 've looked for a while at syllables , and they have a lot of good properties , but i i i if you go all the way to words , I mean , that 's really {disfmarker} I mean , d w In many applications you wanna go further . You wanna go to concepts or something , or have {disfmarker} have {disfmarker} have concepts , actions , this sort of thing . </s> PhD E : Yeah . But words would be a nice {disfmarker} </s> Professor B : But , words aren't bad , yeah . And {disfmarker} and </s> PhD E : Yeah , so the common {disfmarker} right , the common wisdom is you can't do words because there 's too many of them , right ? So you have to have some smaller set that you can use , uh , and {disfmarker} and so everybody goes to phonemes . But the problem is that we {disfmarker} we build models of words in terms of phonemes and these models are {disfmarker} are really cartoon - ish , right ? So when you look at conversational speech , for example , you don't see the phonemes that you {disfmarker} that you have in your word models . </s> Professor B : Yeah . But {disfmarker} but {disfmarker} but we 're not trying for models of words here . See , so her here 's maybe where {disfmarker} If the issue is that we 're trying to come up with , um , some sort of intermediate categories which will then be useful for later stuff , uh , then {pause} maybe it doesn't matter that we can't have enough {disfmarker} </s> PhD E : Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . </s> Professor B : I mean , what you wanna do is {disfmarker} is build up these categories that are {disfmarker} that are best for word recognition . </s> PhD E : Right . Right . </s> Professor B : And {disfmarker} and somehow if that 's built into the loop of what the categories {disfmarker} I mean , we do this every day in this very gross way of {disfmarker} of running o a thousand experiments </s> PhD E :  Right . </s> Professor B : because we have fast computers and picking the thing that has the best word error rate . </s> PhD E : Yeah . </s> Professor B : In some way {disfmarker} I mean , we derive that all the time . In some ways it 's really not {comment} a bad {disfmarker} bad thing to do because it tells you in fact how your adjustments at the very low level affect the {disfmarker} the final goal . </s> PhD E : Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . </s> Professor B : Um , so maybe there 's a way to even put that in in a much more automatic way , </s> PhD E : Right . </s> Professor B : where you take , you know , something about the error at the level of the word or some other {disfmarker} it could be syllable {disfmarker} but in some large unit , </s> PhD E : Uh - huh . </s> Professor B : uh , and uh {disfmarker} yeah , you may not have word models , you have phone models , whatever , but you sort of {pause} don't worry about that , and just somehow feed it back through . </s> PhD E : Mm - hmm . </s> Professor B : You know , so that 's , uh , wh what I called a useless comments because I 'm not really telling you how to do it . But I mean , it 's a {disfmarker} {vocalsound} it 's {disfmarker} it 's , you know {disfmarker} it </s> PhD E : No , but I think the important part in there is that , you know , if you want to be discriminative , you have to have uh , you know , categories . </s> Professor B : Right . </s> PhD E : And I think this {disfmarker} the important categories are the words , and {pause} not the phones . </s> Professor B : Yeah . Yeah . </s> PhD E : Maybe . And so {disfmarker} Right . If you can put the words in to the loop somehow for determining goodness of your sets of clusters {disfmarker} Uh {disfmarker} </s> Professor B : Now , that being said , I think that {disfmarker} that if you have something that is , um {disfmarker} i Once you start dealing with spontaneous speech , all the things you 're saying are {disfmarker} are really true . </s> PhD E : Mm - hmm . </s> Professor B : If you {pause} have read speech that 's been manually annotated , like TIMIT , then , you know , i i you the phones are gonna be right , actually , {vocalsound} for the most part . </s> PhD E : Yeah . Yeah , </s> Professor B : So {disfmarker} so , uh , it doesn't really hurt them to {disfmarker} to do that , to put in discrimination at that level . </s> PhD E : yeah . </s> Professor B : Um , if you go to spontaneous speech then it 's {disfmarker} it 's trickier and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and , uh , the phones are {disfmarker} uh , you know , it 's gonna be based on bad pronunciation models that you have of {disfmarker} </s> PhD E : </s> Professor B : and , um {disfmarker} And it won't allow for the overlapping phenomenon </s> PhD E : Mmm . So it 's almost like there 's this mechanism that we have that , you know , when {disfmarker} when we 're hearing read speech and all the phonemes are there you know , we {disfmarker} we deal with that , but {disfmarker} but when we go to conversational , and then all of a sudden not all the phonemes are there , it doesn't really matter that much to us as humans because we have some kind of mechanism that allows for these word models , whatever those models are , to be {pause} munged , you know , and {disfmarker} and it doesn't really hurt , and I 'm not sure how {disfmarker} {vocalsound} how to build that in . Uh . </s> Professor B : Yeah , I mean , I guess the other thing i is {disfmarker} is to think of a little bit {disfmarker} I mean , we when y when you start looking at these kind of results I think it usually is {disfmarker} is pretty intuitive , but start looking at um , what are the kinds of confusions that you do make , uh , you know , between words if you want or {disfmarker} or {disfmarker} or , uh , even phones in {disfmarker} in {disfmarker} in {disfmarker} in read speech , say , uh , when there is noise . You know , so is it more across place or more across manner ? Or is it cor you know , is it {disfmarker} ? </s> Grad C : Mm - hmm . </s> Professor B : I mean , I know one thing that happens is that you {disfmarker} you {disfmarker} you , uh , you lose the , um , uh , low energy phones . I mean , if there 's added noise then low energy phones {vocalsound} sometimes don't get heard . And if that {disfmarker} if that is {disfmarker} if it {disfmarker} uh , if that turns it into another word or {disfmarker} or different {disfmarker} you know , or another pair of words or something , then it 's more likely to happen . But , um , I don't know , I w I would {disfmarker} I would guess that you 'd {disfmarker} </s> Grad C : Mm - hmm . </s> Professor B : W I don't know . Anyway , that 's {disfmarker} </s> PhD E : I think part of the difficulty is that a l a lot of the robustness that we have is probably coming from a much higher level . </s> Professor B : Mm - hmm . </s> PhD E : You know , we understand the context of the situation when we 're having a conversation . And so if there 's noise in there , you know , our brain fills in and imagines what {disfmarker} what should be there . </s> Professor B : Well that {disfmarker} </s> Grad C : Yeah . We 're {disfmarker} we 're doing some sort of prediction of what {disfmarker} </s> PhD E : Yeah , exactly . </s> Professor B : Oh , sure , that 's really big . </s> Grad C : Yeah . </s> Professor B : Uh , but I mean , even if you do um , uh , diagnostic rhyme test kind of things , you know , where there really isn't an any information like that , uh , people are still better in noise than they {disfmarker} than they are in {disfmarker} in , uh {disfmarker} uh , than the machines are . </s> PhD E : Hmm . </s> Professor B : So , I mean , that 's {disfmarker} i Right . We can't {disfmarker} we can't get it at all without any language models . Language models are there and important but {disfmarker} but , uh {disfmarker} Uh . If we 're not working on that then {vocalsound} we should work on something else and improve it , but {disfmarker} especially if it looks like the potential is there . So {disfmarker} Should we do some digits ? </s> PhD E : Yeah . </s> Professor B : Since we 're here ? </s> PhD E : Go ahead , Morgan . </s> Professor B : OK . </s> PhD E : OK . </s> Professor B : That 's all folks .",

    "article": "Professor B : OK . Uh . Got anything to tell us ? </s> Grad C : Um . Well , I 've been reading some literature about clustering of data . Just , um , I guess , let me put it in context . OK , so we 're talking about discovering intermediate categories to , um {disfmarker} to classify . And , uh , I was looking at some of the work that , uh , Sangita was doing on these TRAPS things . So she has , um {disfmarker} she has temporal patterns for , um , a certain set of phonemes , from {disfmarker} from TIMIT , right ? the most common phonemes . And each one of them has {disfmarker} has a {disfmarker} a nice pattern over time , a one {disfmarker} one second window . And it has {disfmarker} has these patterns . Um , so she has , um a TRAP for each one of the phonemes , um , times fifteen , for each of the fifteen critical bands . And , um , {vocalsound} she does this agglomerative hierarchical clustering which {disfmarker} which basically , um , is a clustering algorithm that , uh , starts with many , many , many different points {disfmarker} many different clusters {disfmarker} uh , corresponding to the number of data , uh , patterns that you have in the data . And then you have this distance mej metric which , uh , measures how {disfmarker} how closely related they are . And you start , um {vocalsound} by merging the patterns that are most closely related . </s> PhD E : And you create a tree . </s> Grad C : And y yeah , yeah , a dendrogram tree . </s> PhD E : Mm - hmm . </s> Grad C : Um . </s> PhD E : And then you can pick , uh , values anywhere along that tree to fix your set of clusters . </s> Grad C : Right , usually it 's when , um {disfmarker} when the sol similarity measures , um , don't go down as much . </s> PhD E : Mm - hmm . </s> Grad C : And so , uh {disfmarker} so you stop at that point . And what she found was , sh um , was there were five broad , um {disfmarker} broad categories , uh , corresponding to , uh , things like , uh , fricatives and , uh , vocalic , um , and , uh , stops . </s> Professor B : Mm - hmm . </s> Grad C : And , uh , one for silence and {disfmarker} and another one for schwa {disfmarker} schwa sounds . Um , and , um , I was thinking about ways to {disfmarker} to generalize this because w you 're {disfmarker} it 's sort of like a {disfmarker} it 's not a completely automatic way of clustering , because yo beforehand you have these {disfmarker} these TRAPS and you 're saying that {disfmarker} that these frames correspond to this particular phoneme . Um , and that 's {disfmarker} that 's constraining your {disfmarker} your clustering to {disfmarker} to the set of phonemes that you already have . Um , whereas maybe we want to just take {disfmarker} take a look at , um , arbitrary windows in time , um , of varying length , um , and cluster those . </s> PhD E : Mm - hmm . </s> Grad C : And I 'm thinking if we {disfmarker} if we do that , then we would probably , um , at some point in the clustering algorithm find that we 've clustered things like , OK , thi this is a transition , um , this is a relatively stable {disfmarker} stable point . </s> PhD E : Mm - hmm . </s> Grad C : Um , and I 'm hoping to find other things of {disfmarker} of similarity and maybe use these things as the intermediate , um {disfmarker} intermediate categories that , uh , um , I 'll later classify . </s> PhD E : Mm - hmm . </s> Professor B : Are you looking at these in narrow bands ? </s> Grad C : Um , right . F um , I 'm {disfmarker} </s> Professor B : Cuz that 's what you 're gonna be using , right ? </s> Grad C : Yeah , yeah . I {disfmarker} I haven't exactly figured out , um , the exact details for that but , uh , the {disfmarker} the representation of the data that I was thinking of , was using , um , critical band , um , energies , {vocalsound} um , over different lengths of time . So {disfmarker} Yeah . </s> Professor B : Yeah , I mean , it seems somehow that needs th uh , there 's a couple things that I wonder about with this . I mean , so one is {disfmarker} is , {pause} again , looking at the same representation , </s> Grad C : OK . </s> Professor B : I mean , if you 're going for this sort of thing where you have {pause} uh , little detectors that are looking at narrow bands , then what you 're going to be looking for should be some category that you can find with the narrow bands . </s> Grad C : Mm - hmm . </s> Professor B : That {disfmarker} that seems to be kind of fundamental to it . Um , and then the other thing , uh , is {disfmarker} that I wonder about with it , and {disfmarker} and don't take this in the wrong way , like I {disfmarker} I know what I 'm doing or anything , </s> Grad C : Right . </s> Professor B : but , I mean . {vocalsound} Um , just wondering really . </s> Grad C : Mm - hmm . </s> Professor B : Um , the sort of standard answer about this sort of thing is that if you 're trying to find {pause} the right system in some sense , whether you 're trying by categories or {disfmarker} or parameters {pause} um , and your goal is discrimination , then having choices based on discrimination as opposed to , um , unsupervised nearness of things , um , is actually better . </s> Grad C : Hmm . </s> Professor B : Um , and I don't know if that {disfmarker} I mean , since you 're dealing with issues of robustness , you know , maybe {disfmarker} maybe this isn't right , but it 'd be something I 'd be concerned about . Because , for instance , you can imagine , uh , uh , i i if you remember from {disfmarker} from , uh {disfmarker} from your {disfmarker} your quals , John Ohala saying that , uh , \" buh \" {comment} and \" puh \" {comment} differed , uh , not really cuz of voicing but because of aspiration . I mean , in as far as wha what 's really there in the acoustics . </s> Grad C : Mm - hmm . </s> Professor B : So , um , if you looked {disfmarker} if you were doing some coarse clustering , you probably would put those two sounds together . And yet , I would gue I would guess that many of your recognition errors were coming from , uh , um , pfft , {comment} screwing up on this distinction . </s> Grad C : Mm - hmm . </s> Professor B : So , in fact , it 's a little hard because recognizers , to first order , sort of work . And the reasons we 're doing the things we 're doing is because they don't work as well as we 'd like . And since they sort of work , uh , it means that they are already doing {disfmarker} if you go and take any recognizer that 's already out there and you say , \" how well is it distinguishing between {pause} schwas and stops ? \" </s> Grad C : Mm - hmm . </s> Professor B : Boy , I bet they 're all doing nearly perfectly on this , right ? </s> Grad C : Mm - hmm . </s> Professor B : So these {disfmarker} these big categories that differ in huge obvious ways , we already know how to do . So , what are we bringing to the party ? I mean , in fact what we wanna do is have something that , particularly in the presence of noise , uh , is better at distinguishing between , uh , categories that are actually close to one another , and hence , would probably be clustered together . </s> Grad C : Mmm . </s> Professor B : So that 's th that 's the hard thing . I mean , I understand that there 's this other constraint that you 're considering , is that you wanna have categories that , uh {disfmarker} that would be straightforward for , say , a human being to mark if you had manual annotation . And it 's something that you really think you can pick up . But I think it 's also essential that you wanna look at what are the {vocalsound} confusions that you 're making and how can you come up with , uh , categories that , uh , can clarify these confusions . </s> Grad C : Mm - hmm . Hmm . </s> Professor B : So , I mean , the standard sort of way of doing that is take a look at the algorithms you 're looking at , but then throw in some discriminative aspect to it .  Y y this is more like , you know , how does LDA differ from PCA ? I mean , they 're the same sort of thing . They 're both orthogonalizing . </s> Grad C : Right . </s> Professor B : But , you know {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and , um , this is a little harder because you 're not just trying to find parameters . You 're actually trying to find the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the categories themselves . Uh , so a little more like brain surgery , I think on yourself . Uh . So , uh </s> Grad C : Yeah . </s> Professor B : Um , anyway . That 's my {pause} thought . </s> Grad C : OK . </s> Professor B : You 've been thinking about this problem for a long time actually . I mean , well {disfmarker} W actually , you stopped thinking about it for a long time , but you used to think about it {vocalsound} a lot . </s> PhD E : Yeah . </s> Professor B : And you 've been thinking about it more now , </s> PhD D : Yeah . </s> Professor B : these categories . </s> PhD E : Yeah . </s> Professor B : Mm - hmm . </s> PhD E : I guess {disfmarker} I don't {disfmarker} I don't {disfmarker} um , it 's not clear to me how to reconcile , you know , what you 're saying , which I think is right , with {pause} the way I 've been looking at it . That it 's {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} it 's all not very clear to me . But it seems to me that the desire {disfmarker} the desirable feature to have is something that , um , is bottom - up . You know , however we do that . </s> Professor B : Mm - hmm . </s> PhD E : And and so I guess what I don't understand is how to do that and still be discriminative , because to be discriminative you have to have categories and the only categories that we know of to use are sort of these human {disfmarker} human sig significant {disfmarker} categories that are significant to humans , like phonemes , things like that . </s> Professor B : Right . </s> PhD E : But that 's sort of what you want to avoid . And so that feels {disfmarker} I don't know how to get out of this . </s> Professor B : Well , here 's a {disfmarker} here 's a , uh , uh Here 's a generic and possibly useless thought , which is , {vocalsound} um , what do you really {disfmarker} I mean , in a sense the only s s systems that make sense , uh , are ones that {disfmarker} that have something from top - down in th in them . Right ? Because if e even the smallest organism that 's trying to learn to do anything , if it doesn't have any kind of reward for doing {disfmarker} or penal penalty for doing anything , then it 's just going to behave randomly . </s> PhD E : Mm - hmm . </s> Professor B : So whether you 're talking about something being learned through evolution or being learned through experience , it 's gotta have something come down to it that gives its reward or , you know , at least some reinforcement learning , </s> PhD E : Right . </s> Professor B : right ? </s> PhD E : So the question is , how far down ? </s> Professor B : And </s> PhD E : We could stop at words , but we don't , right ? We go all the way down to phonemes . </s> Professor B : Right , but I me I {disfmarker} I think that maybe in some ways part of the difficulty is {disfmarker} is trying to deal with the {disfmarker} with these phonemes .

And , uh , I was looking at some of the work that , uh , Sangita was doing on these TRAPS things . So she has , um {disfmarker} she has temporal patterns for , um , a certain set of phonemes , from {disfmarker} from TIMIT , right ? the most common phonemes . And each one of them has {disfmarker} has a {disfmarker} a nice pattern over time , a one {disfmarker} one second window . And it has {disfmarker} has these patterns . Um , so she has , um a TRAP for each one of the phonemes , um , times fifteen , for each of the fifteen critical bands . And , um , {vocalsound} she does this agglomerative hierarchical clustering which {disfmarker} which basically , um , is a clustering algorithm that , uh , starts with many , many , many different points {disfmarker} many different clusters {disfmarker} uh , corresponding to the number of data , uh , patterns that you have in the data .

And what she found was , sh um , was there were five broad , um {disfmarker} broad categories , uh , corresponding to , uh , things like , uh , fricatives and , uh , vocalic , um , and , uh , stops . </s> Professor B : Mm - hmm . </s> Grad C : And , uh , one for silence and {disfmarker} and another one for schwa {disfmarker} schwa sounds . Um , and , um , I was thinking about ways to {disfmarker} to generalize this because w you 're {disfmarker} it 's sort of like a {disfmarker} it 's not a completely automatic way of clustering , because yo beforehand you have these {disfmarker} these TRAPS and you 're saying that {disfmarker} that these frames correspond to this particular phoneme . Um , and that 's {disfmarker} that 's constraining your {disfmarker} your clustering to {disfmarker} to the set of phonemes that you already have . Um , whereas maybe we want to just take {disfmarker} take a look at , um , arbitrary windows in time , um , of varying length , um , and cluster those . </s> PhD E : Mm - hmm . </s> Grad C : And I 'm thinking if we {disfmarker} if we do that , then we would probably , um , at some point in the clustering algorithm find that we 've clustered things like , OK , thi this is a transition , um , this is a relatively stable {disfmarker} stable point . </s> PhD E : Mm - hmm . </s> Grad C : Um , and I 'm hoping to find other things of {disfmarker} of similarity and maybe use these things as the intermediate , um {disfmarker} intermediate categories that , uh , um , I 'll later classify . </s> PhD E : Mm - hmm . </s> Professor B : Are you looking at these in narrow bands ? </s> Grad C : Um , right . F um , I 'm {disfmarker} </s> Professor B : Cuz that 's what you 're gonna be using , right ? </s> Grad C : Yeah , yeah . I {disfmarker} I haven't exactly figured out , um , the exact details for that but , uh , the {disfmarker} the representation of the data that I was thinking of , was using , um , critical band , um , energies , {vocalsound} um , over different lengths of time . So {disfmarker} Yeah . </s> Professor B : Yeah , I mean , it seems somehow that needs th uh , there 's a couple things that I wonder about with this . I mean , so one is {disfmarker} is , {pause} again , looking at the same representation , </s> Grad C : OK . </s> Professor B : I mean , if you 're going for this sort of thing where you have {pause} uh , little detectors that are looking at narrow bands , then what you 're going to be looking for should be some category that you can find with the narrow bands . </s> Grad C : Mm - hmm . </s> Professor B : That {disfmarker} that seems to be kind of fundamental to it . Um , and then the other thing , uh , is {disfmarker} that I wonder about with it , and {disfmarker} and don't take this in the wrong way , like I {disfmarker} I know what I 'm doing or anything , </s> Grad C : Right . </s> Professor B : but , I mean . {vocalsound} Um , just wondering really . </s> Grad C : Mm - hmm . </s> Professor B : Um , the sort of standard answer about this sort of thing is that if you 're trying to find {pause} the right system in some sense , whether you 're trying by categories or {disfmarker} or parameters {pause} um , and your goal is discrimination , then having choices based on discrimination as opposed to , um , unsupervised nearness of things , um , is actually better . </s> Grad C : Hmm . </s> Professor B : Um , and I don't know if that {disfmarker} I mean , since you 're dealing with issues of robustness , you know , maybe {disfmarker} maybe this isn't right , but it 'd be something I 'd be concerned about . Because , for instance , you can imagine , uh , uh , i i if you remember from {disfmarker} from , uh {disfmarker} from your {disfmarker} your quals , John Ohala saying that , uh , \" buh \" {comment} and \" puh \" {comment} differed , uh , not really cuz of voicing but because of aspiration . I mean , in as far as wha what 's really there in the acoustics . </s> Grad C : Mm - hmm . </s> Professor B : So , um , if you looked {disfmarker} if you were doing some coarse clustering , you probably would put those two sounds together . And yet , I would gue I would guess that many of your recognition errors were coming from , uh , um , pfft , {comment} screwing up on this distinction . </s> Grad C : Mm - hmm . </s> Professor B : So , in fact , it 's a little hard because recognizers , to first order , sort of work . And the reasons we 're doing the things we 're doing is because they don't work as well as we 'd like . And since they sort of work , uh , it means that they are already doing {disfmarker} if you go and take any recognizer that 's already out there and you say , \" how well is it distinguishing between {pause} schwas and stops ? \" </s> Grad C : Mm - hmm . </s> Professor B : Boy , I bet they 're all doing nearly perfectly on this , right ? </s> Grad C : Mm - hmm . </s> Professor B : So these {disfmarker} these big categories that differ in huge obvious ways , we already know how to do . So , what are we bringing to the party ? I mean , in fact what we wanna do is have something that , particularly in the presence of noise , uh , is better at distinguishing between , uh , categories that are actually close to one another , and hence , would probably be clustered together . </s> Grad C : Mmm . </s> Professor B : So that 's th that 's the hard thing . I mean , I understand that there 's this other constraint that you 're considering , is that you wanna have categories that , uh {disfmarker} that would be straightforward for , say , a human being to mark if you had manual annotation . And it 's something that you really think you can pick up . But I think it 's also essential that you wanna look at what are the {vocalsound} confusions that you 're making and how can you come up with , uh , categories that , uh , can clarify these confusions . </s> Grad C : Mm - hmm . Hmm . </s> Professor B : So , I mean , the standard sort of way of doing that is take a look at the algorithms you 're looking at , but then throw in some discriminative aspect to it .  Y y this is more like , you know , how does LDA differ from PCA ? I mean , they 're the same sort of thing . They 're both orthogonalizing . </s> Grad C : Right . </s> Professor B : But , you know {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and , um , this is a little harder because you 're not just trying to find parameters . You 're actually trying to find the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the categories themselves . Uh , so a little more like brain surgery , I think on yourself . Uh . So , uh </s> Grad C : Yeah . </s> Professor B : Um , anyway . That 's my {pause} thought . </s> Grad C : OK . </s> Professor B : You 've been thinking about this problem for a long time actually . I mean , well {disfmarker} W actually , you stopped thinking about it for a long time , but you used to think about it {vocalsound} a lot . </s> PhD E : Yeah . </s> Professor B : And you 've been thinking about it more now , </s> PhD D : Yeah . </s> Professor B : these categories . </s> PhD E : Yeah . </s> Professor B : Mm - hmm . </s> PhD E : I guess {disfmarker} I don't {disfmarker} I don't {disfmarker} um , it 's not clear to me how to reconcile , you know , what you 're saying , which I think is right , with {pause} the way I 've been looking at it . That it 's {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} it 's all not very clear to me . But it seems to me that the desire {disfmarker} the desirable feature to have is something that , um , is bottom - up . You know , however we do that . </s> Professor B : Mm - hmm . </s> PhD E : And and so I guess what I don't understand is how to do that and still be discriminative , because to be discriminative you have to have categories and the only categories that we know of to use are sort of these human {disfmarker} human sig significant {disfmarker} categories that are significant to humans , like phonemes , things like that . </s> Professor B : Right . </s> PhD E : But that 's sort of what you want to avoid . And so that feels {disfmarker} I don't know how to get out of this . </s> Professor B : Well , here 's a {disfmarker} here 's a , uh , uh Here 's a generic and possibly useless thought , which is , {vocalsound} um , what do you really {disfmarker} I mean , in a sense the only s s systems that make sense , uh , are ones that {disfmarker} that have something from top - down in th in them . Right ? Because if e even the smallest organism that 's trying to learn to do anything , if it doesn't have any kind of reward for doing {disfmarker} or penal penalty for doing anything , then it 's just going to behave randomly . </s> PhD E : Mm - hmm . </s> Professor B : So whether you 're talking about something being learned through evolution or being learned through experience , it 's gotta have something come down to it that gives its reward or , you know , at least some reinforcement learning , </s> PhD E : Right . </s> Professor B : right ? </s> PhD E : So the question is , how far down ? </s> Professor B : And </s> PhD E : We could stop at words , but we don't , right ? We go all the way down to phonemes . </s> Professor B : Right , but I me I {disfmarker} I think that maybe in some ways part of the difficulty is {disfmarker} is trying to deal with the {disfmarker} with these phonemes . You know , and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and i it 's almost like you want categories if {disfmarker} if our {disfmarker} if our , uh , um , {vocalsound} metric of {disfmarker} of goodness , uh , i if our {disfmarker} </s> PhD E : Mm - hmm . </s> Professor B : correction {disfmarker} if our metric of badness {vocalsound} is word error rate then , um , maybe we should be looking at words . </s> PhD E : Mm - hmm . </s> Professor B : I mean , for {disfmarker} for {disfmarker} for very nice , uh , reasons we 've looked for a while at syllables , and they have a lot of good properties , but i i i if you go all the way to words , I mean , that 's really {disfmarker} I mean , d w In many applications you wanna go further . You wanna go to concepts or something , or have {disfmarker} have {disfmarker} have concepts , actions , this sort of thing . </s> PhD E : Yeah . But words would be a nice {disfmarker} </s> Professor B : But , words aren't bad , yeah . And {disfmarker} and </s> PhD E : Yeah , so the common {disfmarker} right , the common wisdom is you can't do words because there 's too many of them , right ? So you have to have some smaller set that you can use , uh , and {disfmarker} and so everybody goes to phonemes . But the problem is that we {disfmarker} we build models of words in terms of phonemes and these models are {disfmarker} are really cartoon - ish , right ? So when you look at conversational speech , for example , you don't see the phonemes that you {disfmarker} that you have in your word models . </s> Professor B : Yeah . But {disfmarker} but {disfmarker} but we 're not trying for models of words here . See , so her here 's maybe where {disfmarker} If the issue is that we 're trying to come up with , um , some sort of intermediate categories which will then be useful for later stuff , uh , then {pause} maybe it doesn't matter that we can't have enough {disfmarker} </s> PhD E : Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . </s> Professor B : I mean , what you wanna do is {disfmarker} is build up these categories that are {disfmarker} that are best for word recognition . </s> PhD E : Right . Right . </s> Professor B : And {disfmarker} and somehow if that 's built into the loop of what the categories {disfmarker} I mean , we do this every day in this very gross way of {disfmarker} of running o a thousand experiments </s> PhD E :  Right . </s> Professor B : because we have fast computers and picking the thing that has the best word error rate . </s> PhD E : Yeah . </s> Professor B : In some way {disfmarker} I mean , we derive that all the time . In some ways it 's really not {comment} a bad {disfmarker} bad thing to do because it tells you in fact how your adjustments at the very low level affect the {disfmarker} the final goal . </s> PhD E : Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . </s> Professor B : Um , so maybe there 's a way to even put that in in a much more automatic way , </s> PhD E : Right . </s> Professor B : where you take , you know , something about the error at the level of the word or some other {disfmarker} it could be syllable {disfmarker} but in some large unit , </s> PhD E : Uh - huh . </s> Professor B : uh , and uh {disfmarker} yeah , you may not have word models , you have phone models , whatever , but you sort of {pause} don't worry about that , and just somehow feed it back through . </s> PhD E : Mm - hmm . </s> Professor B : You know , so that 's , uh , wh what I called a useless comments because I 'm not really telling you how to do it . But I mean , it 's a {disfmarker} {vocalsound} it 's {disfmarker} it 's , you know {disfmarker} it </s> PhD E : No , but I think the important part in there is that , you know , if you want to be discriminative , you have to have uh , you know , categories . </s> Professor B : Right . </s> PhD E : And I think this {disfmarker} the important categories are the words , and {pause} not the phones . </s> Professor B : Yeah . Yeah . </s> PhD E : Maybe . And so {disfmarker} Right . If you can put the words in to the loop somehow for determining goodness of your sets of clusters {disfmarker} Uh {disfmarker} </s> Professor B : Now , that being said , I think that {disfmarker} that if you have something that is , um {disfmarker} i Once you start dealing with spontaneous speech , all the things you 're saying are {disfmarker} are really true . </s> PhD E : Mm - hmm . </s> Professor B : If you {pause} have read speech that 's been manually annotated , like TIMIT , then , you know , i i you the phones are gonna be right , actually , {vocalsound} for the most part . </s> PhD E : Yeah . Yeah , </s> Professor B : So {disfmarker} so , uh , it doesn't really hurt them to {disfmarker} to do that , to put in discrimination at that level . </s> PhD E : yeah . </s> Professor B : Um , if you go to spontaneous speech then it 's {disfmarker} it 's trickier and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and , uh , the phones are {disfmarker} uh , you know , it 's gonna be based on bad pronunciation models that you have of {disfmarker} </s> PhD E : </s> Professor B : and , um {disfmarker} And it won't allow for the overlapping phenomenon </s> PhD E : Mmm . So it 's almost like there 's this mechanism that we have that , you know , when {disfmarker} when we 're hearing read speech and all the phonemes are there you know , we {disfmarker} we deal with that , but {disfmarker} but when we go to conversational , and then all of a sudden not all the phonemes are there , it doesn't really matter that much to us as humans because we have some kind of mechanism that allows for these word models , whatever those models are , to be {pause} munged , you know , and {disfmarker} and it doesn't really hurt , and I 'm not sure how {disfmarker} {vocalsound} how to build that in . Uh . </s> Professor B : Yeah , I mean , I guess the other thing i is {disfmarker} is to think of a little bit {disfmarker} I mean , we when y when you start looking at these kind of results I think it usually is {disfmarker} is pretty intuitive , but start looking at um , what are the kinds of confusions that you do make , uh , you know , between words if you want or {disfmarker} or {disfmarker} or , uh , even phones in {disfmarker} in {disfmarker} in {disfmarker} in read speech , say , uh , when there is noise . You know , so is it more across place or more across manner ? Or is it cor you know , is it {disfmarker} ? </s> Grad C : Mm - hmm . </s> Professor B : I mean , I know one thing that happens is that you {disfmarker} you {disfmarker} you , uh , you lose the , um , uh , low energy phones . I mean , if there 's added noise then low energy phones {vocalsound} sometimes don't get heard . And if that {disfmarker} if that is {disfmarker} if it {disfmarker} uh , if that turns it into another word or {disfmarker} or different {disfmarker} you know , or another pair of words or something , then it 's more likely to happen . But , um , I don't know , I w I would {disfmarker} I would guess that you 'd {disfmarker} </s> Grad C : Mm - hmm . </s> Professor B : W I don't know . Anyway , that 's {disfmarker} </s> PhD E : I think part of the difficulty is that a l a lot of the robustness that we have is probably coming from a much higher level . </s> Professor B : Mm - hmm . </s> PhD E : You know , we understand the context of the situation when we 're having a conversation .

You wanna go to concepts or something , or have {disfmarker} have {disfmarker} have concepts , actions , this sort of thing . </s> PhD E : Yeah . But words would be a nice {disfmarker} </s> Professor B : But , words aren't bad , yeah . And {disfmarker} and </s> PhD E : Yeah , so the common {disfmarker} right , the common wisdom is you can't do words because there 's too many of them , right ? So you have to have some smaller set that you can use , uh , and {disfmarker} and so everybody goes to phonemes . But the problem is that we {disfmarker} we build models of words in terms of phonemes and these models are {disfmarker} are really cartoon - ish , right ? So when you look at conversational speech , for example , you don't see the phonemes that you {disfmarker} that you have in your word models . </s> Professor B : Yeah . But {disfmarker} but {disfmarker} but we 're not trying for models of words here . See , so her here 's maybe where {disfmarker} If the issue is that we 're trying to come up with , um , some sort of intermediate categories which will then be useful for later stuff , uh , then {pause} maybe it doesn't matter that we can't have enough {disfmarker} </s> PhD E : Mm - hmm .

Mm - hmm . </s> Professor B : Um , so maybe there 's a way to even put that in in a much more automatic way , </s> PhD E : Right . </s> Professor B : where you take , you know , something about the error at the level of the word or some other {disfmarker} it could be syllable {disfmarker} but in some large unit , </s> PhD E : Uh - huh . </s> Professor B : uh , and uh {disfmarker} yeah , you may not have word models , you have phone models , whatever , but you sort of {pause} don't worry about that , and just somehow feed it back through . </s> PhD E : Mm - hmm . </s> Professor B : You know , so that 's , uh , wh what I called a useless comments because I 'm not really telling you how to do it . But I mean , it 's a {disfmarker} {vocalsound} it 's {disfmarker} it 's , you know {disfmarker} it </s> PhD E : No , but I think the important part in there is that , you know , if you want to be discriminative , you have to have uh , you know , categories . </s> Professor B : Right . </s> PhD E : And I think this {disfmarker} the important categories are the words , and {pause} not the phones . </s> Professor B : Yeah . Yeah . </s> PhD E : Maybe . And so {disfmarker} Right . If you can put the words in to the loop somehow for determining goodness of your sets of clusters {disfmarker} Uh {disfmarker} </s> Professor B : Now , that being said , I think that {disfmarker} that if you have something that is , um {disfmarker} i Once you start dealing with spontaneous speech , all the things you 're saying are {disfmarker} are really true . </s> PhD E : Mm - hmm . </s> Professor B : If you {pause} have read speech that 's been manually annotated , like TIMIT , then , you know , i i you the phones are gonna be right , actually , {vocalsound} for the most part . </s> PhD E : Yeah . Yeah , </s> Professor B : So {disfmarker} so , uh , it doesn't really hurt them to {disfmarker} to do that , to put in discrimination at that level . </s> PhD E : yeah . </s> Professor B : Um , if you go to spontaneous speech then it 's {disfmarker} it 's trickier and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and , uh , the phones are {disfmarker} uh , you know , it 's gonna be based on bad pronunciation models that you have of {disfmarker} </s> PhD E : </s> Professor B : and , um {disfmarker} And it won't allow for the overlapping phenomenon </s> PhD E : Mmm . So it 's almost like there 's this mechanism that we have that , you know , when {disfmarker} when we 're hearing read speech and all the phonemes are there you know , we {disfmarker} we deal with that , but {disfmarker} but when we go to conversational , and then all of a sudden not all the phonemes are there , it doesn't really matter that much to us as humans because we have some kind of mechanism that allows for these word models , whatever those models are , to be {pause} munged , you know , and {disfmarker} and it doesn't really hurt , and I 'm not sure how {disfmarker} {vocalsound} how to build that in . Uh . </s> Professor B : Yeah , I mean , I guess the other thing i is {disfmarker} is to think of a little bit {disfmarker} I mean , we when y when you start looking at these kind of results I think it usually is {disfmarker} is pretty intuitive , but start looking at um , what are the kinds of confusions that you do make , uh , you know , between words if you want or {disfmarker} or {disfmarker} or , uh , even phones in {disfmarker} in {disfmarker} in {disfmarker} in read speech , say , uh , when there is noise . You know , so is it more across place or more across manner ? Or is it cor you know , is it {disfmarker} ? </s> Grad C : Mm - hmm . </s> Professor B : I mean , I know one thing that happens is that you {disfmarker} you {disfmarker} you , uh , you lose the , um , uh , low energy phones . I mean , if there 's added noise then low energy phones {vocalsound} sometimes don't get heard . And if that {disfmarker} if that is {disfmarker} if it {disfmarker} uh , if that turns it into another word or {disfmarker} or different {disfmarker} you know , or another pair of words or something , then it 's more likely to happen . But , um , I don't know , I w I would {disfmarker} I would guess that you 'd {disfmarker} </s> Grad C : Mm - hmm . </s> Professor B : W I don't know . Anyway , that 's {disfmarker} </s> PhD E : I think part of the difficulty is that a l a lot of the robustness that we have is probably coming from a much higher level . </s> Professor B : Mm - hmm . </s> PhD E : You know , we understand the context of the situation when we 're having a conversation . And so if there 's noise in there , you know , our brain fills in and imagines what {disfmarker} what should be there . </s> Professor B : Well that {disfmarker} </s> Grad C : Yeah . We 're {disfmarker} we 're doing some sort of prediction of what {disfmarker} </s> PhD E : Yeah , exactly . </s> Professor B : Oh , sure , that 's really big . </s> Grad C : Yeah . </s> Professor B : Uh , but I mean , even if you do um , uh , diagnostic rhyme test kind of things , you know , where there really isn't an any information like that , uh , people are still better in noise than they {disfmarker} than they are in {disfmarker} in , uh {disfmarker} uh , than the machines are . </s> PhD E : Hmm . </s> Professor B : So , I mean , that 's {disfmarker} i Right . We can't {disfmarker} we can't get it at all without any language models . Language models are there and important but {disfmarker} but , uh {disfmarker} Uh . If we 're not working on that then {vocalsound} we should work on something else and improve it , but {disfmarker} especially if it looks like the potential is there . So {disfmarker} Should we do some digits ? </s> PhD E : Yeah . </s> Professor B : Since we 're here ? </s> PhD E : Go ahead , Morgan . </s> Professor B : OK . </s> PhD E : OK . </s> Professor B : That 's all folks .",

    "article": "Professor B : OK . Uh . Got anything to tell us ? </s> Grad C : Um . Well , I 've been reading some literature about clustering of data . Just , um , I guess , let me put it in context . OK , so we 're talking about discovering intermediate categories to , um {disfmarker} to classify . And , uh , I was looking at some of the work that , uh , Sangita was doing on these TRAPS things . So she has , um {disfmarker} she has temporal patterns for , um , a certain set of phonemes , from {disfmarker} from TIMIT , right ? the most common phonemes . And each one of them has {disfmarker} has a {disfmarker} a nice pattern over time , a one {disfmarker} one second window . And it has {disfmarker} has these patterns . Um , so she has , um a TRAP for each one of the phonemes , um , times fifteen , for each of the fifteen critical bands . And , um , {vocalsound} she does this agglomerative hierarchical clustering which {disfmarker} which basically , um , is a clustering algorithm that , uh , starts with many , many , many different points {disfmarker} many different clusters {disfmarker} uh , corresponding to the number of data , uh , patterns that you have in the data . And then you have this distance mej metric which , uh , measures how {disfmarker} how closely related they are . And you start , um {vocalsound} by merging the patterns that are most closely related . </s> PhD E : And you create a tree . </s> Grad C : And y yeah , yeah , a dendrogram tree . </s> PhD E : Mm - hmm . </s> Grad C : Um . </s> PhD E : And then you can pick , uh , values anywhere along that tree to fix your set of clusters . </s> Grad C : Right , usually it 's when , um {disfmarker} when the sol similarity measures , um , don't go down as much . </s> PhD E : Mm - hmm . </s> Grad C : And so , uh {disfmarker} so you stop at that point . And what she found was , sh um , was there were five broad , um {disfmarker} broad categories , uh , corresponding to , uh , things like , uh , fricatives and , uh , vocalic , um , and , uh , stops . </s> Professor B : Mm - hmm . </s> Grad C : And , uh , one for silence and {disfmarker} and another one for schwa {disfmarker} schwa sounds . Um , and , um , I was thinking about ways to {disfmarker} to generalize this because w you 're {disfmarker} it 's sort of like a {disfmarker} it 's not a completely automatic way of clustering , because yo beforehand you have these {disfmarker} these TRAPS and you 're saying that {disfmarker} that these frames correspond to this particular phoneme . Um , and that 's {disfmarker} that 's constraining your {disfmarker} your clustering to {disfmarker} to the set of phonemes that you already have . Um , whereas maybe we want to just take {disfmarker} take a look at , um , arbitrary windows in time , um , of varying length , um , and cluster those . </s> PhD E : Mm - hmm . </s> Grad C : And I 'm thinking if we {disfmarker} if we do that , then we would probably , um , at some point in the clustering algorithm find that we 've clustered things like , OK , thi this is a transition , um , this is a relatively stable {disfmarker} stable point . </s> PhD E : Mm - hmm . </s> Grad C : Um , and I 'm hoping to find other things of {disfmarker} of similarity and maybe use these things as the intermediate , um {disfmarker} intermediate categories that , uh , um , I 'll later classify . </s> PhD E : Mm - hmm . </s> Professor B : Are you looking at these in narrow bands ? </s> Grad C : Um , right . F um , I 'm {disfmarker} </s> Professor B : Cuz that 's what you 're gonna be using , right ? </s> Grad C : Yeah , yeah . I {disfmarker} I haven't exactly figured out , um , the exact details for that but , uh , the {disfmarker} the representation of the data that I was thinking of , was using , um , critical band , um , energies , {vocalsound} um , over different lengths of time . So {disfmarker} Yeah . </s> Professor B : Yeah , I mean , it seems somehow that needs th uh , there 's a couple things that I wonder about with this . I mean , so one is {disfmarker} is , {pause} again , looking at the same representation , </s> Grad C : OK . </s> Professor B : I mean , if you 're going for this sort of thing where you have {pause} uh , little detectors that are looking at narrow bands , then what you 're going to be looking for should be some category that you can find with the narrow bands . </s> Grad C : Mm - hmm . </s> Professor B : That {disfmarker} that seems to be kind of fundamental to it . Um , and then the other thing , uh , is {disfmarker} that I wonder about with it , and {disfmarker} and don't take this in the wrong way , like I {disfmarker} I know what I 'm doing or anything , </s> Grad C : Right . </s> Professor B : but , I mean . {vocalsound} Um , just wondering really . </s> Grad C : Mm - hmm . </s> Professor B : Um , the sort of standard answer about this sort of thing is that if you 're trying to find {pause} the right system in some sense , whether you 're trying by categories or {disfmarker} or parameters {pause} um , and your goal is discrimination , then having choices based on discrimination as opposed to , um , unsupervised nearness of things , um , is actually better . </s> Grad C : Hmm . </s> Professor B : Um , and I don't know if that {disfmarker} I mean , since you 're dealing with issues of robustness , you know , maybe {disfmarker} maybe this isn't right , but it 'd be something I 'd be concerned about .

And , uh , I was looking at some of the work that , uh , Sangita was doing on these TRAPS things . So she has , um {disfmarker} she has temporal patterns for , um , a certain set of phonemes , from {disfmarker} from TIMIT , right ? the most common phonemes . And each one of them has {disfmarker} has a {disfmarker} a nice pattern over time , a one {disfmarker} one second window . And it has {disfmarker} has these patterns . Um , so she has , um a TRAP for each one of the phonemes , um , times fifteen , for each of the fifteen critical bands . And , um , {vocalsound} she does this agglomerative hierarchical clustering which {disfmarker} which basically , um , is a clustering algorithm that , uh , starts with many , many , many different points {disfmarker} many different clusters {disfmarker} uh , corresponding to the number of data , uh , patterns that you have in the data .

And what she found was , sh um , was there were five broad , um {disfmarker} broad categories , uh , corresponding to , uh , things like , uh , fricatives and , uh , vocalic , um , and , uh , stops . </s> Professor B : Mm - hmm . </s> Grad C : And , uh , one for silence and {disfmarker} and another one for schwa {disfmarker} schwa sounds . Um , and , um , I was thinking about ways to {disfmarker} to generalize this because w you 're {disfmarker} it 's sort of like a {disfmarker} it 's not a completely automatic way of clustering , because yo beforehand you have these {disfmarker} these TRAPS and you 're saying that {disfmarker} that these frames correspond to this particular phoneme . Um , and that 's {disfmarker} that 's constraining your {disfmarker} your clustering to {disfmarker} to the set of phonemes that you already have . Um , whereas maybe we want to just take {disfmarker} take a look at , um , arbitrary windows in time , um , of varying length , um , and cluster those . </s> PhD E : Mm - hmm . </s> Grad C : And I 'm thinking if we {disfmarker} if we do that , then we would probably , um , at some point in the clustering algorithm find that we 've clustered things like , OK , thi this is a transition , um , this is a relatively stable {disfmarker} stable point . </s> PhD E : Mm - hmm . </s> Grad C : Um , and I 'm hoping to find other things of {disfmarker} of similarity and maybe use these things as the intermediate , um {disfmarker} intermediate categories that , uh , um , I 'll later classify . </s> PhD E : Mm - hmm . </s> Professor B : Are you looking at these in narrow bands ? </s> Grad C : Um , right . F um , I 'm {disfmarker} </s> Professor B : Cuz that 's what you 're gonna be using , right ? </s> Grad C : Yeah , yeah . I {disfmarker} I haven't exactly figured out , um , the exact details for that but , uh , the {disfmarker} the representation of the data that I was thinking of , was using , um , critical band , um , energies , {vocalsound} um , over different lengths of time . So {disfmarker} Yeah . </s> Professor B : Yeah , I mean , it seems somehow that needs th uh , there 's a couple things that I wonder about with this . I mean , so one is {disfmarker} is , {pause} again , looking at the same representation , </s> Grad C : OK . </s> Professor B : I mean , if you 're going for this sort of thing where you have {pause} uh , little detectors that are looking at narrow bands , then what you 're going to be looking for should be some category that you can find with the narrow bands . </s> Grad C : Mm - hmm . </s> Professor B : That {disfmarker} that seems to be kind of fundamental to it . Um , and then the other thing , uh , is {disfmarker} that I wonder about with it , and {disfmarker} and don't take this in the wrong way , like I {disfmarker} I know what I 'm doing or anything , </s> Grad C : Right . </s> Professor B : but , I mean . {vocalsound} Um , just wondering really . </s> Grad C : Mm - hmm . </s> Professor B : Um , the sort of standard answer about this sort of thing is that if you 're trying to find {pause} the right system in some sense , whether you 're trying by categories or {disfmarker} or parameters {pause} um , and your goal is discrimination , then having choices based on discrimination as opposed to , um , unsupervised nearness of things , um , is actually better . </s> Grad C : Hmm . </s> Professor B : Um , and I don't know if that {disfmarker} I mean , since you 're dealing with issues of robustness , you know , maybe {disfmarker} maybe this isn't right , but it 'd be something I 'd be concerned about . Because , for instance , you can imagine , uh , uh , i i if you remember from {disfmarker} from , uh {disfmarker} from your {disfmarker} your quals , John Ohala saying that , uh , \" buh \" {comment} and \" puh \" {comment} differed , uh , not really cuz of voicing but because of aspiration . I mean , in as far as wha what 's really there in the acoustics . </s> Grad C : Mm - hmm . </s> Professor B : So , um , if you looked {disfmarker} if you were doing some coarse clustering , you probably would put those two sounds together . And yet , I would gue I would guess that many of your recognition errors were coming from , uh , um , pfft , {comment} screwing up on this distinction . </s> Grad C : Mm - hmm . </s> Professor B : So , in fact , it 's a little hard because recognizers , to first order , sort of work . And the reasons we 're doing the things we 're doing is because they don't work as well as we 'd like . And since they sort of work , uh , it means that they are already doing {disfmarker} if you go and take any recognizer that 's already out there and you say , \" how well is it distinguishing between {pause} schwas and stops ? \" </s> Grad C : Mm - hmm . </s> Professor B : Boy , I bet they 're all doing nearly perfectly on this , right ? </s> Grad C : Mm - hmm . </s> Professor B : So these {disfmarker} these big categories that differ in huge obvious ways , we already know how to do . So , what are we bringing to the party ? I mean , in fact what we wanna do is have something that , particularly in the presence of noise , uh , is better at distinguishing between , uh , categories that are actually close to one another , and hence , would probably be clustered together . </s> Grad C : Mmm . </s> Professor B : So that 's th that 's the hard thing . I mean , I understand that there 's this other constraint that you 're considering , is that you wanna have categories that , uh {disfmarker} that would be straightforward for , say , a human being to mark if you had manual annotation . And it 's something that you really think you can pick up . But I think it 's also essential that you wanna look at what are the {vocalsound} confusions that you 're making and how can you come up with , uh , categories that , uh , can clarify these confusions . </s> Grad C : Mm - hmm . Hmm . </s> Professor B : So , I mean , the standard sort of way of doing that is take a look at the algorithms you 're looking at , but then throw in some discriminative aspect to it .  Y y this is more like , you know , how does LDA differ from PCA ? I mean , they 're the same sort of thing . They 're both orthogonalizing . </s> Grad C : Right . </s> Professor B : But , you know {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and , um , this is a little harder because you 're not just trying to find parameters . You 're actually trying to find the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the categories themselves . Uh , so a little more like brain surgery , I think on yourself . Uh . So , uh </s> Grad C : Yeah . </s> Professor B : Um , anyway . That 's my {pause} thought . </s> Grad C : OK . </s> Professor B : You 've been thinking about this problem for a long time actually . I mean , well {disfmarker} W actually , you stopped thinking about it for a long time , but you used to think about it {vocalsound} a lot . </s> PhD E : Yeah . </s> Professor B : And you 've been thinking about it more now , </s> PhD D : Yeah . </s> Professor B : these categories . </s> PhD E : Yeah . </s> Professor B : Mm - hmm . </s> PhD E : I guess {disfmarker} I don't {disfmarker} I don't {disfmarker} um , it 's not clear to me how to reconcile , you know , what you 're saying , which I think is right , with {pause} the way I 've been looking at it . That it 's {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} it 's all not very clear to me . But it seems to me that the desire {disfmarker} the desirable feature to have is something that , um , is bottom - up . You know , however we do that . </s> Professor B : Mm - hmm . </s> PhD E : And and so I guess what I don't understand is how to do that and still be discriminative , because to be discriminative you have to have categories and the only categories that we know of to use are sort of these human {disfmarker} human sig significant {disfmarker} categories that are significant to humans , like phonemes , things like that . </s> Professor B : Right . </s> PhD E : But that 's sort of what you want to avoid . And so that feels {disfmarker} I don't know how to get out of this . </s> Professor B : Well , here 's a {disfmarker} here 's a , uh , uh Here 's a generic and possibly useless thought , which is , {vocalsound} um , what do you really {disfmarker} I mean , in a sense the only s s systems that make sense , uh , are ones that {disfmarker} that have something from top - down in th in them . Right ? Because if e even the smallest organism that 's trying to learn to do anything , if it doesn't have any kind of reward for doing {disfmarker} or penal penalty for doing anything , then it 's just going to behave randomly . </s> PhD E : Mm - hmm . </s> Professor B : So whether you 're talking about something being learned through evolution or being learned through experience , it 's gotta have something come down to it that gives its reward or , you know , at least some reinforcement learning , </s> PhD E : Right . </s> Professor B : right ? </s> PhD E : So the question is , how far down ? </s> Professor B : And </s> PhD E : We could stop at words , but we don't , right ? We go all the way down to phonemes . </s> Professor B : Right , but I me I {disfmarker} I think that maybe in some ways part of the difficulty is {disfmarker} is trying to deal with the {disfmarker} with these phonemes . You know , and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and i it 's almost like you want categories if {disfmarker} if our {disfmarker} if our , uh , um , {vocalsound} metric of {disfmarker} of goodness , uh , i if our {disfmarker} </s> PhD E : Mm - hmm . </s> Professor B : correction {disfmarker} if our metric of badness {vocalsound} is word error rate then , um , maybe we should be looking at words . </s> PhD E : Mm - hmm . </s> Professor B : I mean , for {disfmarker} for {disfmarker} for very nice , uh , reasons we 've looked for a while at syllables , and they have a lot of good properties , but i i i if you go all the way to words , I mean , that 's really {disfmarker} I mean , d w In many applications you wanna go further . You wanna go to concepts or something , or have {disfmarker} have {disfmarker} have concepts , actions , this sort of thing . </s> PhD E : Yeah . But words would be a nice {disfmarker} </s> Professor B : But , words aren't bad , yeah . And {disfmarker} and </s> PhD E : Yeah , so the common {disfmarker} right , the common wisdom is you can't do words because there 's too many of them , right ? So you have to have some smaller set that you can use , uh , and {disfmarker} and so everybody goes to phonemes . But the problem is that we {disfmarker} we build models of words in terms of phonemes and these models are {disfmarker} are really cartoon - ish , right ? So when you look at conversational speech , for example , you don't see the phonemes that you {disfmarker} that you have in your word models . </s> Professor B : Yeah . But {disfmarker} but {disfmarker} but we 're not trying for models of words here . See , so her here 's maybe where {disfmarker} If the issue is that we 're trying to come up with , um , some sort of intermediate categories which will then be useful for later stuff , uh , then {pause} maybe it doesn't matter that we can't have enough {disfmarker} </s> PhD E : Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . </s> Professor B : I mean , what you wanna do is {disfmarker} is build up these categories that are {disfmarker} that are best for word recognition . </s> PhD E : Right . Right . </s> Professor B : And {disfmarker} and somehow if that 's built into the loop of what the categories {disfmarker} I mean , we do this every day in this very gross way of {disfmarker} of running o a thousand experiments </s> PhD E :  Right . </s> Professor B : because we have fast computers and picking the thing that has the best word error rate . </s> PhD E : Yeah . </s> Professor B : In some way {disfmarker} I mean , we derive that all the time . In some ways it 's really not {comment} a bad {disfmarker} bad thing to do because it tells you in fact how your adjustments at the very low level affect the {disfmarker} the final goal . </s> PhD E : Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . </s> Professor B : Um , so maybe there 's a way to even put that in in a much more automatic way , </s> PhD E : Right . </s> Professor B : where you take , you know , something about the error at the level of the word or some other {disfmarker} it could be syllable {disfmarker} but in some large unit , </s> PhD E : Uh - huh . </s> Professor B : uh , and uh {disfmarker} yeah , you may not have word models , you have phone models , whatever , but you sort of {pause} don't worry about that , and just somehow feed it back through . </s> PhD E : Mm - hmm . </s> Professor B : You know , so that 's , uh , wh what I called a useless comments because I 'm not really telling you how to do it . But I mean , it 's a {disfmarker} {vocalsound} it 's {disfmarker} it 's , you know {disfmarker} it </s> PhD E : No , but I think the important part in there is that , you know , if you want to be discriminative , you have to have uh , you know , categories . </s> Professor B : Right . </s> PhD E : And I think this {disfmarker} the important categories are the words , and {pause} not the phones . </s> Professor B : Yeah . Yeah . </s> PhD E : Maybe . And so {disfmarker} Right . If you can put the words in to the loop somehow for determining goodness of your sets of clusters {disfmarker} Uh {disfmarker} </s> Professor B : Now , that being said , I think that {disfmarker} that if you have something that is , um {disfmarker} i Once you start dealing with spontaneous speech , all the things you 're saying are {disfmarker} are really true . </s> PhD E : Mm - hmm . </s> Professor B : If you {pause} have read speech that 's been manually annotated , like TIMIT , then , you know , i i you the phones are gonna be right , actually , {vocalsound} for the most part . </s> PhD E : Yeah .

We go all the way down to phonemes . </s> Professor B : Right , but I me I {disfmarker} I think that maybe in some ways part of the difficulty is {disfmarker} is trying to deal with the {disfmarker} with these phonemes . You know , and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and i it 's almost like you want categories if {disfmarker} if our {disfmarker} if our , uh , um , {vocalsound} metric of {disfmarker} of goodness , uh , i if our {disfmarker} </s> PhD E : Mm - hmm . </s> Professor B : correction {disfmarker} if our metric of badness {vocalsound} is word error rate then , um , maybe we should be looking at words . </s> PhD E : Mm - hmm . </s> Professor B : I mean , for {disfmarker} for {disfmarker} for very nice , uh , reasons we 've looked for a while at syllables , and they have a lot of good properties , but i i i if you go all the way to words , I mean , that 's really {disfmarker} I mean , d w In many applications you wanna go further . You wanna go to concepts or something , or have {disfmarker} have {disfmarker} have concepts , actions , this sort of thing . </s> PhD E : Yeah . But words would be a nice {disfmarker} </s> Professor B : But , words aren't bad , yeah . And {disfmarker} and </s> PhD E : Yeah , so the common {disfmarker} right , the common wisdom is you can't do words because there 's too many of them , right ? So you have to have some smaller set that you can use , uh , and {disfmarker} and so everybody goes to phonemes . But the problem is that we {disfmarker} we build models of words in terms of phonemes and these models are {disfmarker} are really cartoon - ish , right ? So when you look at conversational speech , for example , you don't see the phonemes that you {disfmarker} that you have in your word models . </s> Professor B : Yeah . But {disfmarker} but {disfmarker} but we 're not trying for models of words here . See , so her here 's maybe where {disfmarker} If the issue is that we 're trying to come up with , um , some sort of intermediate categories which will then be useful for later stuff , uh , then {pause} maybe it doesn't matter that we can't have enough {disfmarker} </s> PhD E : Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . </s> Professor B : I mean , what you wanna do is {disfmarker} is build up these categories that are {disfmarker} that are best for word recognition . </s> PhD E : Right . Right . </s> Professor B : And {disfmarker} and somehow if that 's built into the loop of what the categories {disfmarker} I mean , we do this every day in this very gross way of {disfmarker} of running o a thousand experiments </s> PhD E :  Right . </s> Professor B : because we have fast computers and picking the thing that has the best word error rate . </s> PhD E : Yeah . </s> Professor B : In some way {disfmarker} I mean , we derive that all the time . In some ways it 's really not {comment} a bad {disfmarker} bad thing to do because it tells you in fact how your adjustments at the very low level affect the {disfmarker} the final goal . </s> PhD E : Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . </s> Professor B : Um , so maybe there 's a way to even put that in in a much more automatic way , </s> PhD E : Right . </s> Professor B : where you take , you know , something about the error at the level of the word or some other {disfmarker} it could be syllable {disfmarker} but in some large unit , </s> PhD E : Uh - huh . </s> Professor B : uh , and uh {disfmarker} yeah , you may not have word models , you have phone models , whatever , but you sort of {pause} don't worry about that , and just somehow feed it back through . </s> PhD E : Mm - hmm . </s> Professor B : You know , so that 's , uh , wh what I called a useless comments because I 'm not really telling you how to do it . But I mean , it 's a {disfmarker} {vocalsound} it 's {disfmarker} it 's , you know {disfmarker} it </s> PhD E : No , but I think the important part in there is that , you know , if you want to be discriminative , you have to have uh , you know , categories . </s> Professor B : Right . </s> PhD E : And I think this {disfmarker} the important categories are the words , and {pause} not the phones . </s> Professor B : Yeah . Yeah . </s> PhD E : Maybe . And so {disfmarker} Right . If you can put the words in to the loop somehow for determining goodness of your sets of clusters {disfmarker} Uh {disfmarker} </s> Professor B : Now , that being said , I think that {disfmarker} that if you have something that is , um {disfmarker} i Once you start dealing with spontaneous speech , all the things you 're saying are {disfmarker} are really true . </s> PhD E : Mm - hmm . </s> Professor B : If you {pause} have read speech that 's been manually annotated , like TIMIT , then , you know , i i you the phones are gonna be right , actually , {vocalsound} for the most part . </s> PhD E : Yeah . Yeah , </s> Professor B : So {disfmarker} so , uh , it doesn't really hurt them to {disfmarker} to do that , to put in discrimination at that level . </s> PhD E : yeah . </s> Professor B : Um , if you go to spontaneous speech then it 's {disfmarker} it 's trickier and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and , uh , the phones are {disfmarker} uh , you know , it 's gonna be based on bad pronunciation models that you have of {disfmarker} </s> PhD E : </s> Professor B : and , um {disfmarker} And it won't allow for the overlapping phenomenon </s> PhD E : Mmm . So it 's almost like there 's this mechanism that we have that , you know , when {disfmarker} when we 're hearing read speech and all the phonemes are there you know , we {disfmarker} we deal with that , but {disfmarker} but when we go to conversational , and then all of a sudden not all the phonemes are there , it doesn't really matter that much to us as humans because we have some kind of mechanism that allows for these word models , whatever those models are , to be {pause} munged , you know , and {disfmarker} and it doesn't really hurt , and I 'm not sure how {disfmarker} {vocalsound} how to build that in . Uh . </s> Professor B : Yeah , I mean , I guess the other thing i is {disfmarker} is to think of a little bit {disfmarker} I mean , we when y when you start looking at these kind of results I think it usually is {disfmarker} is pretty intuitive , but start looking at um , what are the kinds of confusions that you do make , uh , you know , between words if you want or {disfmarker} or {disfmarker} or , uh , even phones in {disfmarker} in {disfmarker} in {disfmarker} in read speech , say , uh , when there is noise . You know , so is it more across place or more across manner ? Or is it cor you know , is it {disfmarker} ? </s> Grad C : Mm - hmm . </s> Professor B : I mean , I know one thing that happens is that you {disfmarker} you {disfmarker} you , uh , you lose the , um , uh , low energy phones . I mean , if there 's added noise then low energy phones {vocalsound} sometimes don't get heard . And if that {disfmarker} if that is {disfmarker} if it {disfmarker} uh , if that turns it into another word or {disfmarker} or different {disfmarker} you know , or another pair of words or something , then it 's more likely to happen . But , um , I don't know , I w I would {disfmarker} I would guess that you 'd {disfmarker} </s> Grad C : Mm - hmm . </s> Professor B : W I don't know . Anyway , that 's {disfmarker} </s> PhD E : I think part of the difficulty is that a l a lot of the robustness that we have is probably coming from a much higher level . </s> Professor B : Mm - hmm . </s> PhD E : You know , we understand the context of the situation when we 're having a conversation . And so if there 's noise in there , you know , our brain fills in and imagines what {disfmarker} what should be there . </s> Professor B : Well that {disfmarker} </s> Grad C : Yeah . We 're {disfmarker} we 're doing some sort of prediction of what {disfmarker} </s> PhD E : Yeah , exactly . </s> Professor B : Oh , sure , that 's really big . </s> Grad C : Yeah . </s> Professor B : Uh , but I mean , even if you do um , uh , diagnostic rhyme test kind of things , you know , where there really isn't an any information like that , uh , people are still better in noise than they {disfmarker} than they are in {disfmarker} in , uh {disfmarker} uh , than the machines are . </s> PhD E : Hmm . </s> Professor B : So , I mean , that 's {disfmarker} i Right . We can't {disfmarker} we can't get it at all without any language models . Language models are there and important but {disfmarker} but , uh {disfmarker} Uh . If we 're not working on that then {vocalsound} we should work on something else and improve it , but {disfmarker} especially if it looks like the potential is there . So {disfmarker} Should we do some digits ? </s> PhD E : Yeah . </s> Professor B : Since we 're here ? </s> PhD E : Go ahead , Morgan . </s> Professor B : OK . </s> PhD E : OK . </s> Professor B : That 's all folks .",

And , um , {vocalsound} she does this agglomerative hierarchical clustering which {disfmarker} which basically , um , is a clustering algorithm that , uh , starts with many , many , many different points {disfmarker} many different clusters {disfmarker} uh , corresponding to the number of data , uh , patterns that you have in the data .

    "article": "Professor B : OK . Uh . Got anything to tell us ? </s> Grad C : Um . Well , I 've been reading some literature about clustering of data . Just , um , I guess , let me put it in context . OK , so we 're talking about discovering intermediate categories to , um {disfmarker} to classify . And , uh , I was looking at some of the work that , uh , Sangita was doing on these TRAPS things . So she has , um {disfmarker} she has temporal patterns for , um , a certain set of phonemes , from {disfmarker} from TIMIT , right ? the most common phonemes . And each one of them has {disfmarker} has a {disfmarker} a nice pattern over time , a one {disfmarker} one second window . And it has {disfmarker} has these patterns . Um , so she has , um a TRAP for each one of the phonemes , um , times fifteen , for each of the fifteen critical bands . And , um , {vocalsound} she does this agglomerative hierarchical clustering which {disfmarker} which basically , um , is a clustering algorithm that , uh , starts with many , many , many different points {disfmarker} many different clusters {disfmarker} uh , corresponding to the number of data , uh , patterns that you have in the data . And then you have this distance mej metric which , uh , measures how {disfmarker} how closely related they are . And you start , um {vocalsound} by merging the patterns that are most closely related . </s> PhD E : And you create a tree . </s> Grad C : And y yeah , yeah , a dendrogram tree . </s> PhD E : Mm - hmm . </s> Grad C : Um . </s> PhD E : And then you can pick , uh , values anywhere along that tree to fix your set of clusters . </s> Grad C : Right , usually it 's when , um {disfmarker} when the sol similarity measures , um , don't go down as much . </s> PhD E : Mm - hmm . </s> Grad C : And so , uh {disfmarker} so you stop at that point . And what she found was , sh um , was there were five broad , um {disfmarker} broad categories , uh , corresponding to , uh , things like , uh , fricatives and , uh , vocalic , um , and , uh , stops . </s> Professor B : Mm - hmm . </s> Grad C : And , uh , one for silence and {disfmarker} and another one for schwa {disfmarker} schwa sounds . Um , and , um , I was thinking about ways to {disfmarker} to generalize this because w you 're {disfmarker} it 's sort of like a {disfmarker} it 's not a completely automatic way of clustering , because yo beforehand you have these {disfmarker} these TRAPS and you 're saying that {disfmarker} that these frames correspond to this particular phoneme . Um , and that 's {disfmarker} that 's constraining your {disfmarker} your clustering to {disfmarker} to the set of phonemes that you already have . Um , whereas maybe we want to just take {disfmarker} take a look at , um , arbitrary windows in time , um , of varying length , um , and cluster those . </s> PhD E : Mm - hmm . </s> Grad C : And I 'm thinking if we {disfmarker} if we do that , then we would probably , um , at some point in the clustering algorithm find that we 've clustered things like , OK , thi this is a transition , um , this is a relatively stable {disfmarker} stable point . </s> PhD E : Mm - hmm . </s> Grad C : Um , and I 'm hoping to find other things of {disfmarker} of similarity and maybe use these things as the intermediate , um {disfmarker} intermediate categories that , uh , um , I 'll later classify . </s> PhD E : Mm - hmm . </s> Professor B : Are you looking at these in narrow bands ? </s> Grad C : Um , right . F um , I 'm {disfmarker} </s> Professor B : Cuz that 's what you 're gonna be using , right ? </s> Grad C : Yeah , yeah . I {disfmarker} I haven't exactly figured out , um , the exact details for that but , uh , the {disfmarker} the representation of the data that I was thinking of , was using , um , critical band , um , energies , {vocalsound} um , over different lengths of time . So {disfmarker} Yeah . </s> Professor B : Yeah , I mean , it seems somehow that needs th uh , there 's a couple things that I wonder about with this . I mean , so one is {disfmarker} is , {pause} again , looking at the same representation , </s> Grad C : OK . </s> Professor B : I mean , if you 're going for this sort of thing where you have {pause} uh , little detectors that are looking at narrow bands , then what you 're going to be looking for should be some category that you can find with the narrow bands . </s> Grad C : Mm - hmm . </s> Professor B : That {disfmarker} that seems to be kind of fundamental to it . Um , and then the other thing , uh , is {disfmarker} that I wonder about with it , and {disfmarker} and don't take this in the wrong way , like I {disfmarker} I know what I 'm doing or anything , </s> Grad C : Right . </s> Professor B : but , I mean . {vocalsound} Um , just wondering really . </s> Grad C : Mm - hmm . </s> Professor B : Um , the sort of standard answer about this sort of thing is that if you 're trying to find {pause} the right system in some sense , whether you 're trying by categories or {disfmarker} or parameters {pause} um , and your goal is discrimination , then having choices based on discrimination as opposed to , um , unsupervised nearness of things , um , is actually better . </s> Grad C : Hmm . </s> Professor B : Um , and I don't know if that {disfmarker} I mean , since you 're dealing with issues of robustness , you know , maybe {disfmarker} maybe this isn't right , but it 'd be something I 'd be concerned about . Because , for instance , you can imagine , uh , uh , i i if you remember from {disfmarker} from , uh {disfmarker} from your {disfmarker} your quals , John Ohala saying that , uh , \" buh \" {comment} and \" puh \" {comment} differed , uh , not really cuz of voicing but because of aspiration . I mean , in as far as wha what 's really there in the acoustics . </s> Grad C : Mm - hmm . </s> Professor B : So , um , if you looked {disfmarker} if you were doing some coarse clustering , you probably would put those two sounds together . And yet , I would gue I would guess that many of your recognition errors were coming from , uh , um , pfft , {comment} screwing up on this distinction . </s> Grad C : Mm - hmm . </s> Professor B : So , in fact , it 's a little hard because recognizers , to first order , sort of work . And the reasons we 're doing the things we 're doing is because they don't work as well as we 'd like . And since they sort of work , uh , it means that they are already doing {disfmarker} if you go and take any recognizer that 's already out there and you say , \" how well is it distinguishing between {pause} schwas and stops ? \" </s> Grad C : Mm - hmm . </s> Professor B : Boy , I bet they 're all doing nearly perfectly on this , right ? </s> Grad C : Mm - hmm . </s> Professor B : So these {disfmarker} these big categories that differ in huge obvious ways , we already know how to do . So , what are we bringing to the party ? I mean , in fact what we wanna do is have something that , particularly in the presence of noise , uh , is better at distinguishing between , uh , categories that are actually close to one another , and hence , would probably be clustered together . </s> Grad C : Mmm . </s> Professor B : So that 's th that 's the hard thing . I mean , I understand that there 's this other constraint that you 're considering , is that you wanna have categories that , uh {disfmarker} that would be straightforward for , say , a human being to mark if you had manual annotation . And it 's something that you really think you can pick up . But I think it 's also essential that you wanna look at what are the {vocalsound} confusions that you 're making and how can you come up with , uh , categories that , uh , can clarify these confusions . </s> Grad C : Mm - hmm . Hmm . </s> Professor B : So , I mean , the standard sort of way of doing that is take a look at the algorithms you 're looking at , but then throw in some discriminative aspect to it .  Y y this is more like , you know , how does LDA differ from PCA ? I mean , they 're the same sort of thing . They 're both orthogonalizing . </s> Grad C : Right . </s> Professor B : But , you know {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and , um , this is a little harder because you 're not just trying to find parameters . You 're actually trying to find the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the categories themselves . Uh , so a little more like brain surgery , I think on yourself . Uh . So , uh </s> Grad C : Yeah . </s> Professor B : Um , anyway . That 's my {pause} thought . </s> Grad C : OK . </s> Professor B : You 've been thinking about this problem for a long time actually . I mean , well {disfmarker} W actually , you stopped thinking about it for a long time , but you used to think about it {vocalsound} a lot . </s> PhD E : Yeah . </s> Professor B : And you 've been thinking about it more now , </s> PhD D : Yeah . </s> Professor B : these categories . </s> PhD E : Yeah . </s> Professor B : Mm - hmm . </s> PhD E : I guess {disfmarker} I don't {disfmarker} I don't {disfmarker} um , it 's not clear to me how to reconcile , you know , what you 're saying , which I think is right , with {pause} the way I 've been looking at it . That it 's {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} it 's all not very clear to me . But it seems to me that the desire {disfmarker} the desirable feature to have is something that , um , is bottom - up . You know , however we do that . </s> Professor B : Mm - hmm . </s> PhD E : And and so I guess what I don't understand is how to do that and still be discriminative , because to be discriminative you have to have categories and the only categories that we know of to use are sort of these human {disfmarker} human sig significant {disfmarker} categories that are significant to humans , like phonemes , things like that . </s> Professor B : Right . </s> PhD E : But that 's sort of what you want to avoid . And so that feels {disfmarker} I don't know how to get out of this . </s> Professor B : Well , here 's a {disfmarker} here 's a , uh , uh Here 's a generic and possibly useless thought , which is , {vocalsound} um , what do you really {disfmarker} I mean , in a sense the only s s systems that make sense , uh , are ones that {disfmarker} that have something from top - down in th in them . Right ? Because if e even the smallest organism that 's trying to learn to do anything , if it doesn't have any kind of reward for doing {disfmarker} or penal penalty for doing anything , then it 's just going to behave randomly . </s> PhD E : Mm - hmm . </s> Professor B : So whether you 're talking about something being learned through evolution or being learned through experience , it 's gotta have something come down to it that gives its reward or , you know , at least some reinforcement learning , </s> PhD E : Right . </s> Professor B : right ? </s> PhD E : So the question is , how far down ? </s> Professor B : And </s> PhD E : We could stop at words , but we don't , right ?

Is these are these the colours that {disfmarker} of production , or is this just what we had available ? </s> User Interface : Well I'm {disfmarker} We're gonna have again the the sort of the foggy um yellow from last time that lit up when you pushed the button . </s> Marketing : Right . </s> Project Manager : Okay so just {disfmarker} </s> User Interface : Um {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : could you just list all the things that it does s so I can write them in the report . </s> User Interface : But um {vocalsound} this button um , because it's red it's sort of very prominent , we're gonna use it as uh {disfmarker} it can be the power button if you hold it for maybe two seconds it'll send a stand-by signal . </s> Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Excuse me . </s> Project Manager : Mm-hmm . </s> User Interface : Um apart from that it's gonna be used as a confirm button for the L_C_D_ screen </s> Industrial Designer : Sure . </s> Project Manager : Okay . </s> User Interface : and you use this as a jog-dial . </s> Project Manager : Okay so that's like an okay button , right . </s> Marketing : Mm-hmm . </s> Industrial Designer : Oh we've discussed how h high it is , but how wide is it ? {vocalsound} </s> User Interface : I don't know . {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : Okay . </s> Marketing : How high is it ? </s> Industrial Designer : No as in the height , but what about the width ? </s> Marketing : Yeah . </s> Project Manager : Oh oh </s> User Interface : Didn't put five centimetres . </s> Project Manager : like depth of the actual thing . </s> Industrial Designer : Do we need five ? I don't think five is {disfmarker} </s> User Interface : Um . </s> Industrial Designer : be about th three and a half . </s> Marketing : Okay . </s> Project Manager : Oh is this k to get an idea of scale from your from your thing there okay . </s> User Interface : Something by there . </s> Industrial Designer : Yeah , yeah . </s> Marketing : Sure . </s> Project Manager : So you can power on and off , what else can you do ? </s> Marketing : Three and a half . </s> User Interface : Um you can skip straight to a channel using these buttons . </s> Project Manager : Okay . </s> User Interface : Um , were gonna have the volume control here , but um because we've got the the L_C_D_ and the jog-dial we just thought we'd um use that as the volume . </s> Project Manager : Okay jog-dial for volume . And what else do you do with the jog-dial ? </s> Marketing : Mm-hmm . </s> User Interface : Um you can use it for um more advanced functions like contrast , colour and {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : Contrast , brightness , </s> User Interface : Um yeah . </s> Project Manager : yeah , and anything else ? </s> User Interface : Um just whatever else we wanted to include as the advanced functions , um we didn't actually go through and specify the {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : Well of the designers what are they ? </s> User Interface : Uh what can a T_V_ do ? </s> Industrial Designer : Okay things like um brightness , contrast , </s> Project Manager : Uh-huh . </s> Industrial Designer : um maybe tuning the channels . </s> Project Manager : Okay channel tuning . </s> Industrial Designer : Um . </s> Project Manager : That's a good one . </s> Industrial Designer : What else ? Um the various inputs . Are you having a V_C_R_ , are you having {disfmarker} you know which input do you have ? </s> Marketing : Mm-hmm , mm-hmm . </s> Project Manager : Okay auxiliary inputs . </s> Marketing : Mm-hmm , </s> Industrial Designer : Um . </s> Marketing : probably colour or sharpness . </s> Industrial Designer : Yep , colour , sharpness . Um a lot of these things will have to be um free and open for users to define them . </s> Project Manager : Sharpness . Okay what about uh sound settings </s> Marketing : Mm-hmm . </s> Project Manager : ? Uh d can you change any of those at all ? </s> Marketing : Audio . </s> Industrial Designer : Audio , we have like your basic y your base , your mid-range , your high range . </s> User Interface : Um . </s> Industrial Designer : Um . </s> User Interface : {gap} the the balance hmm . </s> Industrial Designer : Yep , left-right balance , um maybe even pre-programmed sound modes , like um the user could determine like a series of sound modes , </s> Project Manager : Okay . </s> Industrial Designer : and then what could happen would be um when you click on that then it would go to that setting . </s> Marketing : Mm-hmm . </s> Project Manager : Okay , </s> Marketing : Mm 'kay . </s> Industrial Designer : Yeah .",

Took hundred people and covered all the aspects of what um is needed by people and what they want to see . Um {vocalsound} everything kinda from functionality and how individual functions are {disfmarker} how mu how how often they're used and how much their necessary and stuff . And general opinions about current current remotes . See that , as we kinda noticed , seventy five percent of people find their remote controls ugly . So some kind of a new style should be incorporated that's less ugly {vocalsound} . Uh along with um looking less ugly , if it looks better , eighty percent of people said they'd spend more money on it .

I can empl I kinda take that to mean as um {vocalsound} they they don't uh {disfmarker} they , yeah , they only use {disfmarker} they only work for the television or yeah like as in in my flat I've got six remote controls for a stereo system , a digital box , a D_V_D_ player , a video player and T_V_ . If it was uh {disfmarker} I mean th my behaviour is to use multiple things at the same time and multiple remotes aren't really matched well to my behaviour . {vocalsound} Uh again , seventy five percent is {disfmarker} seventy five percent of users say they zap a lot . I took to mean that they just {disfmarker} they use it a lot , they use it regularly rather than standing up and manually change channels or volume {gap} . {vocalsound} And uh yeah , uh I think the big issue is fifty percent users only use ten percent of the buttons , 'cause uh wh if we got a remote that like {disfmarker} well we'll have some buttons taken off by the lack of teletext , but uh oh and we're going to see uh on the {disfmarker} uh that some of the functions like audio settings aren't h hardly ever used and used very {disfmarker} aren't considered relevant by the user . So I think maybe fewer buttons , which also make the design look sleeker , I dunno . Uh um yeah and uh frustrations of like people losing remote control . </s> Project Manager : Mm . </s> Marketing : I dunno maybe some kind of system of you press a button on the T_V_ or maybe that's b it would have to incorporate {gap} , but like some kind of system where you can f use something else to find the remote control . Maybe like it'll beep or something . And um , yep , the uh time taken to learn new remote controls is {disfmarker} Uh don't want to make it too complicated , easy to use for uh new {disfmarker} like first time users and stuff . And uh repetitive strain injury , I suppose we should make it more comfortable and make ma possibly even use {disfmarker} have to make it , yeah , fewer buttons , like I was saying about the whole mice {disfmarker} the mouse idea of it feels more comfortable . </s> Project Manager : Mm . </s> Marketing : Maybe don't even have to hold it as such . </s> Project Manager : Gosh , must be some telly addicts out there if they get R_S_I_ from their television remote , is all I can say . </s> Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} </s> User Interface : {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : But uh yeah . It also asked um if we would {disfmarker} if people would pay more for speech recognition </s> Project Manager : {vocalsound} {gap} </s> Marketing : and younger people say they would . And uh there was another section on our {disfmarker} on the report for uh L_C_D_ displays , but the data wasn't there , so . I don't actually know what the results for that were , </s> Project Manager : Mm . Right . Mm . </s> Marketing : so . {vocalsound} May be incrementally emitting , but yeah . </s> Project Manager : Yeah , I must say that um the uh {disfmarker} I c can't remember what {vocalsound} um f you know phone service I was using the other day , but that had sorta speech recognition which worked uh remarkably well , so that is indeed a uh um a thought </s> Marketing : And uh {vocalsound} it would cut out the R_S_I_ as well if you {disfmarker} {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : and it it cuts out uh {disfmarker} I was was gonna say , you can't get a lot of R_S_I_ , </s> Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : j just get jaw ache . Okay , sorry . {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : Yeah , um {disfmarker} oh yeah , so possibly the speech recognition is possibly something could add into the design . Oh , I've got some other things I couldn't fit onto this presentation . Um . You see this okay ? Almost {disfmarker} no ? It's {disfmarker} sorry it's a bit {gap} . I'll read out to you . Uh functionality , uh like people's opinions on functionality , the relevance to the remote and how often they're used . So um like the power . Using the using the d swi the power switch to switch on T_V_ is a high relevance of nine , but it's not frequently used . You see what I mean ? </s> Project Manager : Yeah . {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : Whereas channel selection , which is very high relevance </s> Project Manager : Mm-hmm . </s> Marketing : is used the most . So m we can maybe even start to cut down on {disfmarker} or I was possibly even thinking of a design that maybe some of the buttons are hidden from everyday use . Maybe like uh a folding ledge or something . So that we can maybe go into the channel settings and the audio settings , </s> Industrial Designer : Mm . </s> Marketing : which are low relevance </s> Project Manager : {vocalsound} Mm-hmm . I mean {disfmarker} </s> Marketing : and rarely used . And keep the v volume selection and channel selection very easily {disfmarker} </s> User Interface : It could be {disfmarker} oh uh I was just gonna say uh maybe like the flip phones that they use ? </s> Industrial Designer : Mm . </s> User Interface : Have you seen the new mo mobile phones </s> Project Manager : {vocalsound} Yeah . </s> User Interface : that flip out and they have the like texting , and then the numbers on one side , </s> Marketing : Oh yeah . </s> User Interface : so </s> Project Manager : Mm . </s> User Interface : you could have the most {vocalsound} used buttons on top and flip it out or something . </s> Project Manager : Hmm , hmm . </s> Industrial Designer : Mm . </s> Marketing : Yeah , like the one that like slides back </s> Project Manager : Uh . Should we actually bite the bullet here ? </s> Marketing : and the buttons are concealed underneath . </s> User Interface : Yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : Mm . </s> Project Manager : If people really don't use those buttons to any extent at all um {vocalsound} remove them altogether . </s> Marketing : Just remove them completely ? </s> Project Manager : We we could actually have we could actually have a remote control with um {disfmarker} </s> User Interface : That might be the {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : I wonder whether we could get the remote control with no buttons at all if we went for voice recognition , given that um the {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Um now the the age structure we were looking at {disfmarker} um I mean w we had usage by age structure , what we didn't have was what proportion of people using remotes were in those particular age groups . Now do we know whether they {disfmarker} </s> Marketing : Uh yeah . </s> Project Manager : Forty {disfmarker} no sorry {disfmarker} for forty five to fifty five age group , uh to put myself right in the middle of it , um u use remote controls to a great extent . </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} </s> Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : Yes we {disfmarker} </s> Marketing : Um no this is for {disfmarker} pay more for speech recognition . </s> Project Manager : That would 've speech recogn right . So , we're looking at {disfmarker} um well again , we don't know the relative proportion {disfmarker} the relative numbers in the age groups . </s> Marketing : Yeah , that's true . </s> Project Manager : If we wanted something different , truly different , then the buttonless remote control w would be it . </s> Industrial Designer : P Well the only problem I can think of with that is if you've got a lot of people that don't wanna be bothered learning how to use new rem remote controls . If you just kind of take away everything that they're used to knowing , that's gonna be quite a change . </s> Project Manager : But if you just lift it up and say , channel one or B_B_C_ {disfmarker} </s> Industrial Designer : It might {disfmarker} </s> Marketing : Or even {disfmarker} I mean you could even just have it left on . </s> User Interface : Maybe i </s> Marketing : You could just put it down once on top your T_V_ and never have to {disfmarker} </s> User Interface : Yeah , have a big kind of like the satellite box or the cable box </s> Project Manager : {vocalsound} </s> User Interface : and have it just go on the T_V_ and then it doesn't matter where in the room you are , </s> Industrial Designer : Mm . </s> User Interface : you won't lose it . </s> Marketing : Yeah . </s> Project Manager : It c well it {disfmarker} I can I can see technical problems with that in terms of the , you know , the sound from the television , </s> Industrial Designer : Mm . </s> User Interface : No . </s> Project Manager : because if somebody actually on the television says uh uh , you know , I_T_V_ and you're watching B_B_C_ then then it might um change itself , </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} B_B_C_ one . {vocalsound} </s> Industrial Designer : Yeah . {vocalsound} </s> User Interface : {vocalsound} Oh . {vocalsound} </s> Industrial Designer : Yeah . </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : so it probably needs to be um {disfmarker} possibly actually need a button on it </s> User Interface : Yeah , that's true . </s> Project Manager : just to activate it . </s> Marketing : Oh yeah . </s> Project Manager : Or or something just to identify that you've lifted it up and it's use . And and then just say , oh I don't know , a thought and and then {disfmarker} </s> User Interface : Yeah . </s> Project Manager : uh I mean that that would certainly be uh truly different . {vocalsound} Um 'cause uh you know audio settings , nought point eight percent . I mean if they weren't there , {vocalsound} would people miss them ? </s> Marketing : Mm-mm . </s> Industrial Designer : But look at the importance of them . The volume settings . </s> Project Manager : {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : Relevance of two out of ten , </s> Project Manager : Vol volume , </s> Marketing : yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : Yeah . </s> Project Manager : yes um </s> Industrial Designer : They're not used often </s> Project Manager : th {vocalsound} </s> Industrial Designer : but they are quite important when they're used . </s> Project Manager : w we need to s identify things that {vocalsound} people actually need </s> Industrial Designer : Yeah . </s> Project Manager : and and it's a function of frequency and relevance . And um I would say ignoring ig ignoring power for the moment , um the channel and volume </s> Industrial Designer : Mm . </s> Project Manager : and th w w given given that we've been told to ignore teletext . Uh channel and volume are the only ones that </s> Marketing : Yeah . </s> Project Manager : {vocalsound} uh would appear to be essential . </s> Marketing : Stand out . </s> Project Manager : Um . So {disfmarker} if we can design something that that looks interesting , know , or looks different , um incorporates the the logo and and the colours and um we can still have our interchangeable fascias even if it's {gap} the yellow and grey , um and uh I dunno , buttons or or buttons as an option . </s> Marketing : Uh I just had a thought actually , sorry to interrupt . </s> Project Manager : Do , please . </s> Marketing : Uh you were saying about um it could {disfmarker} technical problems of like uh someone on the television saying a channel number and it changed {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : Mm-hmm . </s> Marketing : we could maybe have like an activation word . </s> Project Manager : You cer certainly could . </s> Marketing : 'Cause I've seen I've seen this used on computers before , where you just {disfmarker} you address the remote , </s> Project Manager : {vocalsound} Depe uh i depends whether um {disfmarker} </s> Industrial Designer : Mm . </s> Marketing : you address the computer , and then give it a command . </s> Project Manager : if we want to make this so simple that anybody can walk into the room and lift it up and say </s> Marketing : Oh I see . Oh yeah , I see . </s> Project Manager : B_B_C_ one . Um okay , I mean you could print {disfmarker} actually print it on the uh </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} Mm-hmm , yeah . </s> Project Manager : device itself . Um . </s> Marketing : I mean I'm just thinking of the point of view of peop you could still like lose this remote . </s> Project Manager : S th this I th {vocalsound} that's always gonna be a problem I think . </s> Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : Mm . </s> Project Manager : Um and I I I s so I suppose one um {disfmarker} could make it so desirable that if people lose it they immediately go out and buy another one . </s> Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} </s> User Interface : {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : Anyway , sorry , carry on . Do you want to just carry on with {disfmarker} </s> Marketing : Oh no </s> Project Manager : or {disfmarker} </s> Marketing : I I interrupted you , </s> Project Manager : no no , no uh b I was in the middle of in the middle of your report there . {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : sorry {vocalsound} . Oh okay . Um well , I was just kinda wrapping up there . Yeah , </s> Project Manager : Mm okay . {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : I was thinking um , yeah , maybe such things are relevant . We could make things much more f I think the the eighty percent of people would spend more on uh a remote uh that looks better , combined with uh decrease the {disfmarker} or take out the limited functio functions that we don't really use much . {gap} alright take out teletext , but as for channel settings and stuff it might it might um turn people somewhe peop some people that want the whole functionality away . But , since {disfmarker} if we're marketing a more kind of fashionable approach then it'd {disfmarker} it would be fashion and fashion over practicality . </s> Project Manager : Mm-hmm . S s we could {disfmarker} we could make it dual function {gap} voice recognition and {gap} still have buttons on it um </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} Oh , we could , yeah . We c yeah , </s> Project Manager : 'cause we're {disfmarker} </s> Marketing : we could even have it as like a {disfmarker} yeah the buttons control this and the voice functions control the f things that you would do all the time , so . </s> Project Manager : {vocalsound} Certainly could . Yeah , yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : Mm . </s> Marketing : So uh yeah , if we could uh {disfmarker} power on and channel selection and and volume selection , wouldn't have to really {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : {gap} The {disfmarker} I mean the the advantage of doing away the buttons altogether is it makes the thing cheaper . </s> Marketing : Yeah and probably it would look better as well . </s> Project Manager : No , it cou certainly opens up the possibility for making it uh , you know , visually very distinctive . </s> Marketing : Yeah . yeah . </s> Project Manager : Um 'cause you know , it does not have to be a oblong box . </s> Industrial Designer : Mm . </s> Marketing : Lined with numbered buttons and {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : Mm , yeah . Okay , who {disfmarker} sorry , have you have you finished there Andy ? </s> Marketing : Uh yeah , yeah , that's everything . </s> Project Manager : Yep , yep . Um {vocalsound} given that we've already had a extensive discussion uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} . </s> Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} </s> User Interface : {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} </s> User Interface : Okay well , I can do mine . </s> Industrial Designer : Hmm . </s> Marketing : Do you want the cable ? </s> User Interface : Yeah , let's see if I can make this work . Um . </s> Industrial Designer : Oh , you have to hit like function and F_ something . </s> User Interface : Oh . </s> Marketing : F_ eight . </s> Industrial Designer : F_ eight . </s> User Interface : Is it doing {disfmarker} </s> Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Dunno . </s> Marketing : Uh , give it about twenty seconds , or so . </s> User Interface : Okay . </s> Project Manager : Ah , there we go . {vocalsound} </s> Industrial Designer : Oh yeah , it's going . </s> User Interface : Oh okay . {vocalsound} Okay , so this is just about the technical functions . </s> Project Manager : Alright . </s> User Interface : So the method , I looked online for examples of other similar products and then just kind of was trying to brainstorm some possible design ideas and um identify what the necessary things are , what people are {disfmarker} what you really wanna have a remote control do . Um and then there are two different kinds that I found . There's a user centred one and an engineering centred one which I will have pictures of and then we kinda have to decide which one this should be . </s> Project Manager : Mm-hmm . </s> User Interface : {vocalsound} So these are the two different ones . This one um {disfmarker} this is the user centred , it has uh quite a few mm uh um fewer buttons </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} </s> User Interface : and then this is the engineering centred , which has a lot more buttons , </s> Project Manager : Mm-hmm . </s> User Interface : and probably this is one that people complain about , about having too many buttons that you don't use . So basically , what a remote control is is you {disfmarker} it's to send messages to the television set , you know , turn on , off , switch the channels and the volume and things such as that . And so for this product it's gonna be television only , and then it has to have the uh logos for the company and the colours . And so , for my personal preferences , I think this one is easier to use and has quite a {disfmarker} you know , fewer buttons . Um we want something that sends messages easily to the television and I was kind of wondering about this example that they have . It looks kind of narrow at the top , and I was thinking maybe if it were wider at the top , </s> Project Manager : Mm , yeah . </s> User Interface : then that would be easier . Um {vocalsound} and so we have to decide what's gonna make our product different . E the unique style , maybe have it light up so it's visible in the dark , um the changeable face-plates , and the lighting up and visible I was {disfmarker} when we were talking about havi losing it , maybe to have a button on the television that you press and it {disfmarker} maybe if it makes a noise or lights up or something like that , so it's easier to find if someone has hidden under the couch or something like that . So that's my presentation . Yeah .",

So that we can maybe go into the channel settings and the audio settings , </s> Industrial Designer : Mm . </s> Marketing : which are low relevance </s> Project Manager : {vocalsound} Mm-hmm .

Should we actually bite the bullet here ? </s> Marketing : and the buttons are concealed underneath . </s> User Interface : Yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : Mm . </s> Project Manager : If people really don't use those buttons to any extent at all um {vocalsound} remove them altogether . </s> Marketing : Just remove them completely ? </s> Project Manager : We we could actually have we could actually have a remote control with um {disfmarker} </s> User Interface : That might be the {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : I wonder whether we could get the remote control with no buttons at all if we went for voice recognition , given that um the {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Um now the the age structure we were looking at {disfmarker} um I mean w we had usage by age structure , what we didn't have was what proportion of people using remotes were in those particular age groups . Now do we know whether they {disfmarker} </s> Marketing : Uh yeah . </s> Project Manager : Forty {disfmarker} no sorry {disfmarker} for forty five to fifty five age group , uh to put myself right in the middle of it , um u use remote controls to a great extent . </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} </s> Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : Yes we {disfmarker} </s> Marketing : Um no this is for {disfmarker} pay more for speech recognition . </s> Project Manager : That would 've speech recogn right . So , we're looking at {disfmarker} um well again , we don't know the relative proportion {disfmarker} the relative numbers in the age groups . </s> Marketing : Yeah , that's true . </s> Project Manager : If we wanted something different , truly different , then the buttonless remote control w would be it . </s> Industrial Designer : P Well the only problem I can think of with that is if you've got a lot of people that don't wanna be bothered learning how to use new rem remote controls . If you just kind of take away everything that they're used to knowing , that's gonna be quite a change . </s> Project Manager : But if you just lift it up and say , channel one or B_B_C_ {disfmarker} </s> Industrial Designer : It might {disfmarker} </s> Marketing : Or even {disfmarker} I mean you could even just have it left on . </s> User Interface : Maybe i </s> Marketing : You could just put it down once on top your T_V_ and never have to {disfmarker} </s> User Interface : Yeah , have a big kind of like the satellite box or the cable box </s> Project Manager : {vocalsound} </s> User Interface : and have it just go on the T_V_ and then it doesn't matter where in the room you are , </s> Industrial Designer : Mm . </s> User Interface : you won't lose it . </s> Marketing : Yeah . </s> Project Manager : It c well it {disfmarker} I can I can see technical problems with that in terms of the , you know , the sound from the television , </s> Industrial Designer : Mm . </s> User Interface : No . </s> Project Manager : because if somebody actually on the television says uh uh , you know , I_T_V_ and you're watching B_B_C_ then then it might um change itself , </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} B_B_C_ one . {vocalsound} </s> Industrial Designer : Yeah . {vocalsound} </s> User Interface : {vocalsound} Oh . {vocalsound} </s> Industrial Designer : Yeah . </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : so it probably needs to be um {disfmarker} possibly actually need a button on it </s> User Interface : Yeah , that's true . </s> Project Manager : just to activate it . </s> Marketing : Oh yeah . </s> Project Manager : Or or something just to identify that you've lifted it up and it's use . And and then just say , oh I don't know , a thought and and then {disfmarker} </s> User Interface : Yeah . </s> Project Manager : uh I mean that that would certainly be uh truly different . {vocalsound} Um 'cause uh you know audio settings , nought point eight percent . I mean if they weren't there , {vocalsound} would people miss them ? </s> Marketing : Mm-mm . </s> Industrial Designer : But look at the importance of them . The volume settings . </s> Project Manager : {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : Relevance of two out of ten , </s> Project Manager : Vol volume , </s> Marketing : yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : Yeah . </s> Project Manager : yes um </s> Industrial Designer : They're not used often </s> Project Manager : th {vocalsound} </s> Industrial Designer : but they are quite important when they're used . </s> Project Manager : w we need to s identify things that {vocalsound} people actually need </s> Industrial Designer : Yeah . </s> Project Manager : and and it's a function of frequency and relevance . And um I would say ignoring ig ignoring power for the moment , um the channel and volume </s> Industrial Designer : Mm . </s> Project Manager : and th w w given given that we've been told to ignore teletext . Uh channel and volume are the only ones that </s> Marketing : Yeah . </s> Project Manager : {vocalsound} uh would appear to be essential . </s> Marketing : Stand out . </s> Project Manager : Um . So {disfmarker} if we can design something that that looks interesting , know , or looks different , um incorporates the the logo and and the colours and um we can still have our interchangeable fascias even if it's {gap} the yellow and grey , um and uh I dunno , buttons or or buttons as an option . </s> Marketing : Uh I just had a thought actually , sorry to interrupt . </s> Project Manager : Do , please . </s> Marketing : Uh you were saying about um it could {disfmarker} technical problems of like uh someone on the television saying a channel number and it changed {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : Mm-hmm . </s> Marketing : we could maybe have like an activation word . </s> Project Manager : You cer certainly could . </s> Marketing : 'Cause I've seen I've seen this used on computers before , where you just {disfmarker} you address the remote , </s> Project Manager : {vocalsound} Depe uh i depends whether um {disfmarker} </s> Industrial Designer : Mm . </s> Marketing : you address the computer , and then give it a command . </s> Project Manager : if we want to make this so simple that anybody can walk into the room and lift it up and say </s> Marketing : Oh I see . Oh yeah , I see . </s> Project Manager : B_B_C_ one . Um okay , I mean you could print {disfmarker} actually print it on the uh </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} Mm-hmm , yeah . </s> Project Manager : device itself . Um . </s> Marketing : I mean I'm just thinking of the point of view of peop you could still like lose this remote . </s> Project Manager : S th this I th {vocalsound} that's always gonna be a problem I think . </s> Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : Mm . </s> Project Manager : Um and I I I s so I suppose one um {disfmarker} could make it so desirable that if people lose it they immediately go out and buy another one . </s> Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} </s> User Interface : {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : Anyway , sorry , carry on . Do you want to just carry on with {disfmarker} </s> Marketing : Oh no </s> Project Manager : or {disfmarker} </s> Marketing : I I interrupted you , </s> Project Manager : no no , no uh b I was in the middle of in the middle of your report there . {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : sorry {vocalsound} . Oh okay . Um well , I was just kinda wrapping up there . Yeah , </s> Project Manager : Mm okay . {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : I was thinking um , yeah , maybe such things are relevant . We could make things much more f I think the the eighty percent of people would spend more on uh a remote uh that looks better , combined with uh decrease the {disfmarker} or take out the limited functio functions that we don't really use much . {gap} alright take out teletext , but as for channel settings and stuff it might it might um turn people somewhe peop some people that want the whole functionality away . But , since {disfmarker} if we're marketing a more kind of fashionable approach then it'd {disfmarker} it would be fashion and fashion over practicality . </s> Project Manager : Mm-hmm . S s we could {disfmarker} we could make it dual function {gap} voice recognition and {gap} still have buttons on it um </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} Oh , we could , yeah . We c yeah , </s> Project Manager : 'cause we're {disfmarker} </s> Marketing : we could even have it as like a {disfmarker} yeah the buttons control this and the voice functions control the f things that you would do all the time , so . </s> Project Manager : {vocalsound} Certainly could . Yeah , yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : Mm . </s> Marketing : So uh yeah , if we could uh {disfmarker} power on and channel selection and and volume selection , wouldn't have to really {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : {gap} The {disfmarker} I mean the the advantage of doing away the buttons altogether is it makes the thing cheaper . </s> Marketing : Yeah and probably it would look better as well . </s> Project Manager : No , it cou certainly opens up the possibility for making it uh , you know , visually very distinctive . </s> Marketing : Yeah . yeah . </s> Project Manager : Um 'cause you know , it does not have to be a oblong box . </s> Industrial Designer : Mm . </s> Marketing : Lined with numbered buttons and {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : Mm , yeah . Okay , who {disfmarker} sorry , have you have you finished there Andy ? </s> Marketing : Uh yeah , yeah , that's everything . </s> Project Manager : Yep , yep . Um {vocalsound} given that we've already had a extensive discussion uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} . </s> Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} </s> User Interface : {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} </s> User Interface : Okay well , I can do mine . </s> Industrial Designer : Hmm . </s> Marketing : Do you want the cable ? </s> User Interface : Yeah , let's see if I can make this work . Um . </s> Industrial Designer : Oh , you have to hit like function and F_ something . </s> User Interface : Oh . </s> Marketing : F_ eight . </s> Industrial Designer : F_ eight . </s> User Interface : Is it doing {disfmarker} </s> Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Dunno . </s> Marketing : Uh , give it about twenty seconds , or so . </s> User Interface : Okay . </s> Project Manager : Ah , there we go . {vocalsound} </s> Industrial Designer : Oh yeah , it's going . </s> User Interface : Oh okay . {vocalsound} Okay , so this is just about the technical functions . </s> Project Manager : Alright . </s> User Interface : So the method , I looked online for examples of other similar products and then just kind of was trying to brainstorm some possible design ideas and um identify what the necessary things are , what people are {disfmarker} what you really wanna have a remote control do . Um and then there are two different kinds that I found . There's a user centred one and an engineering centred one which I will have pictures of and then we kinda have to decide which one this should be . </s> Project Manager : Mm-hmm . </s> User Interface : {vocalsound} So these are the two different ones . This one um {disfmarker} this is the user centred , it has uh quite a few mm uh um fewer buttons </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} </s> User Interface : and then this is the engineering centred , which has a lot more buttons , </s> Project Manager : Mm-hmm . </s> User Interface : and probably this is one that people complain about , about having too many buttons that you don't use . So basically , what a remote control is is you {disfmarker} it's to send messages to the television set , you know , turn on , off , switch the channels and the volume and things such as that . And so for this product it's gonna be television only , and then it has to have the uh logos for the company and the colours . And so , for my personal preferences , I think this one is easier to use and has quite a {disfmarker} you know , fewer buttons . Um we want something that sends messages easily to the television and I was kind of wondering about this example that they have . It looks kind of narrow at the top , and I was thinking maybe if it were wider at the top , </s> Project Manager : Mm , yeah . </s> User Interface : then that would be easier . Um {vocalsound} and so we have to decide what's gonna make our product different . E the unique style , maybe have it light up so it's visible in the dark , um the changeable face-plates , and the lighting up and visible I was {disfmarker} when we were talking about havi losing it , maybe to have a button on the television that you press and it {disfmarker} maybe if it makes a noise or lights up or something like that , so it's easier to find if someone has hidden under the couch or something like that . So that's my presentation . Yeah .",

    "article": "Marketing : Uh I don't mind . {gap} </s> Project Manager : P fine . </s> Marketing : Uh can I steal the cable ? </s> Project Manager : Oh sorry , you can indeed . </s> Marketing : Cheers . </s> Project Manager : {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} I got a {disfmarker} how do I start there ? </s> Project Manager : Oh , if you click on the um uh the one that that looks like a projection screen , no the one to the right of that . That one . </s> Marketing : That one . Cool . Well these are functionality requirements from the {disfmarker} our our guys down in the the research lab . Took hundred people and covered all the aspects of what um is needed by people and what they want to see . Um {vocalsound} everything kinda from functionality and how individual functions are {disfmarker} how mu how how often they're used and how much their necessary and stuff . And general opinions about current current remotes . See that , as we kinda noticed , seventy five percent of people find their remote controls ugly . So some kind of a new style should be incorporated that's less ugly {vocalsound} . Uh along with um looking less ugly , if it looks better , eighty percent of people said they'd spend more money on it . Which is a a plus for us , if we can make it look better , it'd be uh more cost effective and we can put the price up . Current remote controls do not match the operating behaviour of the user . I can empl I kinda take that to mean as um {vocalsound} they they don't uh {disfmarker} they , yeah , they only use {disfmarker} they only work for the television or yeah like as in in my flat I've got six remote controls for a stereo system , a digital box , a D_V_D_ player , a video player and T_V_ . If it was uh {disfmarker} I mean th my behaviour is to use multiple things at the same time and multiple remotes aren't really matched well to my behaviour . {vocalsound} Uh again , seventy five percent is {disfmarker} seventy five percent of users say they zap a lot . I took to mean that they just {disfmarker} they use it a lot , they use it regularly rather than standing up and manually change channels or volume {gap} . {vocalsound} And uh yeah , uh I think the big issue is fifty percent users only use ten percent of the buttons , 'cause uh wh if we got a remote that like {disfmarker} well we'll have some buttons taken off by the lack of teletext , but uh oh and we're going to see uh on the {disfmarker} uh that some of the functions like audio settings aren't h hardly ever used and used very {disfmarker} aren't considered relevant by the user . So I think maybe fewer buttons , which also make the design look sleeker , I dunno . Uh um yeah and uh frustrations of like people losing remote control . </s> Project Manager : Mm . </s> Marketing : I dunno maybe some kind of system of you press a button on the T_V_ or maybe that's b it would have to incorporate {gap} , but like some kind of system where you can f use something else to find the remote control . Maybe like it'll beep or something . And um , yep , the uh time taken to learn new remote controls is {disfmarker} Uh don't want to make it too complicated , easy to use for uh new {disfmarker} like first time users and stuff . And uh repetitive strain injury , I suppose we should make it more comfortable and make ma possibly even use {disfmarker} have to make it , yeah , fewer buttons , like I was saying about the whole mice {disfmarker} the mouse idea of it feels more comfortable . </s> Project Manager : Mm . </s> Marketing : Maybe don't even have to hold it as such . </s> Project Manager : Gosh , must be some telly addicts out there if they get R_S_I_ from their television remote , is all I can say . </s> Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} </s> User Interface : {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : But uh yeah . It also asked um if we would {disfmarker} if people would pay more for speech recognition </s> Project Manager : {vocalsound} {gap} </s> Marketing : and younger people say they would . And uh there was another section on our {disfmarker} on the report for uh L_C_D_ displays , but the data wasn't there , so . I don't actually know what the results for that were , </s> Project Manager : Mm . Right . Mm . </s> Marketing : so . {vocalsound} May be incrementally emitting , but yeah . </s> Project Manager : Yeah , I must say that um the uh {disfmarker} I c can't remember what {vocalsound} um f you know phone service I was using the other day , but that had sorta speech recognition which worked uh remarkably well , so that is indeed a uh um a thought </s> Marketing : And uh {vocalsound} it would cut out the R_S_I_ as well if you {disfmarker} {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : and it it cuts out uh {disfmarker} I was was gonna say , you can't get a lot of R_S_I_ , </s> Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : j just get jaw ache . Okay , sorry . {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : Yeah , um {disfmarker} oh yeah , so possibly the speech recognition is possibly something could add into the design . Oh , I've got some other things I couldn't fit onto this presentation . Um . You see this okay ? Almost {disfmarker} no ? It's {disfmarker} sorry it's a bit {gap} . I'll read out to you . Uh functionality , uh like people's opinions on functionality , the relevance to the remote and how often they're used . So um like the power .

Um . </s> Industrial Designer : Oh , you have to hit like function and F_ something . </s> User Interface : Oh . </s> Marketing : F_ eight . </s> Industrial Designer : F_ eight . </s> User Interface : Is it doing {disfmarker} </s> Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Dunno . </s> Marketing : Uh , give it about twenty seconds , or so . </s> User Interface : Okay . </s> Project Manager : Ah , there we go . {vocalsound} </s> Industrial Designer : Oh yeah , it's going . </s> User Interface : Oh okay . {vocalsound} Okay , so this is just about the technical functions . </s> Project Manager : Alright . </s> User Interface : So the method , I looked online for examples of other similar products and then just kind of was trying to brainstorm some possible design ideas and um identify what the necessary things are , what people are {disfmarker} what you really wanna have a remote control do . Um and then there are two different kinds that I found . There's a user centred one and an engineering centred one which I will have pictures of and then we kinda have to decide which one this should be . </s> Project Manager : Mm-hmm . </s> User Interface : {vocalsound} So these are the two different ones . This one um {disfmarker} this is the user centred , it has uh quite a few mm uh um fewer buttons </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} </s> User Interface : and then this is the engineering centred , which has a lot more buttons , </s> Project Manager : Mm-hmm . </s> User Interface : and probably this is one that people complain about , about having too many buttons that you don't use . So basically , what a remote control is is you {disfmarker} it's to send messages to the television set , you know , turn on , off , switch the channels and the volume and things such as that . And so for this product it's gonna be television only , and then it has to have the uh logos for the company and the colours . And so , for my personal preferences , I think this one is easier to use and has quite a {disfmarker} you know , fewer buttons . Um we want something that sends messages easily to the television and I was kind of wondering about this example that they have . It looks kind of narrow at the top , and I was thinking maybe if it were wider at the top , </s> Project Manager : Mm , yeah . </s> User Interface : then that would be easier . Um {vocalsound} and so we have to decide what's gonna make our product different . E the unique style , maybe have it light up so it's visible in the dark , um the changeable face-plates , and the lighting up and visible I was {disfmarker} when we were talking about havi losing it , maybe to have a button on the television that you press and it {disfmarker} maybe if it makes a noise or lights up or something like that , so it's easier to find if someone has hidden under the couch or something like that . So that's my presentation . Yeah .",

If it was uh {disfmarker} I mean th my behaviour is to use multiple things at the same time and multiple remotes aren't really matched well to my behaviour . {vocalsound} Uh again , seventy five percent is {disfmarker} seventy five percent of users say they zap a lot .

Oh , I've got some other things I couldn't fit onto this presentation . Um . You see this okay ? Almost {disfmarker} no ? It's {disfmarker} sorry it's a bit {gap} . I'll read out to you . Uh functionality , uh like people's opinions on functionality , the relevance to the remote and how often they're used . So um like the power . Using the using the d swi the power switch to switch on T_V_ is a high relevance of nine , but it's not frequently used . You see what I mean ? </s> Project Manager : Yeah . {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : Whereas channel selection , which is very high relevance </s> Project Manager : Mm-hmm . </s> Marketing : is used the most . So m we can maybe even start to cut down on {disfmarker} or I was possibly even thinking of a design that maybe some of the buttons are hidden from everyday use . Maybe like uh a folding ledge or something . So that we can maybe go into the channel settings and the audio settings , </s> Industrial Designer : Mm . </s> Marketing : which are low relevance </s> Project Manager : {vocalsound} Mm-hmm . I mean {disfmarker} </s> Marketing : and rarely used . And keep the v volume selection and channel selection very easily {disfmarker} </s> User Interface : It could be {disfmarker} oh uh I was just gonna say uh maybe like the flip phones that they use ? </s> Industrial Designer : Mm . </s> User Interface : Have you seen the new mo mobile phones </s> Project Manager : {vocalsound} Yeah . </s> User Interface : that flip out and they have the like texting , and then the numbers on one side , </s> Marketing : Oh yeah . </s> User Interface : so </s> Project Manager : Mm . </s> User Interface : you could have the most {vocalsound} used buttons on top and flip it out or something . </s> Project Manager : Hmm , hmm . </s> Industrial Designer : Mm . </s> Marketing : Yeah , like the one that like slides back </s> Project Manager : Uh . Should we actually bite the bullet here ? </s> Marketing : and the buttons are concealed underneath . </s> User Interface : Yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : Mm . </s> Project Manager : If people really don't use those buttons to any extent at all um {vocalsound} remove them altogether . </s> Marketing : Just remove them completely ? </s> Project Manager : We we could actually have we could actually have a remote control with um {disfmarker} </s> User Interface : That might be the {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : I wonder whether we could get the remote control with no buttons at all if we went for voice recognition , given that um the {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Um now the the age structure we were looking at {disfmarker} um I mean w we had usage by age structure , what we didn't have was what proportion of people using remotes were in those particular age groups . Now do we know whether they {disfmarker} </s> Marketing : Uh yeah . </s> Project Manager : Forty {disfmarker} no sorry {disfmarker} for forty five to fifty five age group , uh to put myself right in the middle of it , um u use remote controls to a great extent . </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} </s> Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : Yes we {disfmarker} </s> Marketing : Um no this is for {disfmarker} pay more for speech recognition . </s> Project Manager : That would 've speech recogn right . So , we're looking at {disfmarker} um well again , we don't know the relative proportion {disfmarker} the relative numbers in the age groups . </s> Marketing : Yeah , that's true . </s> Project Manager : If we wanted something different , truly different , then the buttonless remote control w would be it . </s> Industrial Designer : P Well the only problem I can think of with that is if you've got a lot of people that don't wanna be bothered learning how to use new rem remote controls . If you just kind of take away everything that they're used to knowing , that's gonna be quite a change . </s> Project Manager : But if you just lift it up and say , channel one or B_B_C_ {disfmarker} </s> Industrial Designer : It might {disfmarker} </s> Marketing : Or even {disfmarker} I mean you could even just have it left on . </s> User Interface : Maybe i </s> Marketing : You could just put it down once on top your T_V_ and never have to {disfmarker} </s> User Interface : Yeah , have a big kind of like the satellite box or the cable box </s> Project Manager : {vocalsound} </s> User Interface : and have it just go on the T_V_ and then it doesn't matter where in the room you are , </s> Industrial Designer : Mm . </s> User Interface : you won't lose it . </s> Marketing : Yeah . </s> Project Manager : It c well it {disfmarker} I can I can see technical problems with that in terms of the , you know , the sound from the television , </s> Industrial Designer : Mm . </s> User Interface : No . </s> Project Manager : because if somebody actually on the television says uh uh , you know , I_T_V_ and you're watching B_B_C_ then then it might um change itself , </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} B_B_C_ one . {vocalsound} </s> Industrial Designer : Yeah . {vocalsound} </s> User Interface : {vocalsound} Oh . {vocalsound} </s> Industrial Designer : Yeah . </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : so it probably needs to be um {disfmarker} possibly actually need a button on it </s> User Interface : Yeah , that's true . </s> Project Manager : just to activate it . </s> Marketing : Oh yeah . </s> Project Manager : Or or something just to identify that you've lifted it up and it's use . And and then just say , oh I don't know , a thought and and then {disfmarker} </s> User Interface : Yeah . </s> Project Manager : uh I mean that that would certainly be uh truly different . {vocalsound} Um 'cause uh you know audio settings , nought point eight percent . I mean if they weren't there , {vocalsound} would people miss them ? </s> Marketing : Mm-mm . </s> Industrial Designer : But look at the importance of them . The volume settings . </s> Project Manager : {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : Relevance of two out of ten , </s> Project Manager : Vol volume , </s> Marketing : yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : Yeah . </s> Project Manager : yes um </s> Industrial Designer : They're not used often </s> Project Manager : th {vocalsound} </s> Industrial Designer : but they are quite important when they're used . </s> Project Manager : w we need to s identify things that {vocalsound} people actually need </s> Industrial Designer : Yeah . </s> Project Manager : and and it's a function of frequency and relevance . And um I would say ignoring ig ignoring power for the moment , um the channel and volume </s> Industrial Designer : Mm . </s> Project Manager : and th w w given given that we've been told to ignore teletext . Uh channel and volume are the only ones that </s> Marketing : Yeah . </s> Project Manager : {vocalsound} uh would appear to be essential . </s> Marketing : Stand out . </s> Project Manager : Um . So {disfmarker} if we can design something that that looks interesting , know , or looks different , um incorporates the the logo and and the colours and um we can still have our interchangeable fascias even if it's {gap} the yellow and grey , um and uh I dunno , buttons or or buttons as an option . </s> Marketing : Uh I just had a thought actually , sorry to interrupt . </s> Project Manager : Do , please . </s> Marketing : Uh you were saying about um it could {disfmarker} technical problems of like uh someone on the television saying a channel number and it changed {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : Mm-hmm . </s> Marketing : we could maybe have like an activation word . </s> Project Manager : You cer certainly could . </s> Marketing : 'Cause I've seen I've seen this used on computers before , where you just {disfmarker} you address the remote , </s> Project Manager : {vocalsound} Depe uh i depends whether um {disfmarker} </s> Industrial Designer : Mm . </s> Marketing : you address the computer , and then give it a command . </s> Project Manager : if we want to make this so simple that anybody can walk into the room and lift it up and say </s> Marketing : Oh I see . Oh yeah , I see . </s> Project Manager : B_B_C_ one . Um okay , I mean you could print {disfmarker} actually print it on the uh </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} Mm-hmm , yeah . </s> Project Manager : device itself . Um . </s> Marketing : I mean I'm just thinking of the point of view of peop you could still like lose this remote . </s> Project Manager : S th this I th {vocalsound} that's always gonna be a problem I think . </s> Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : Mm . </s> Project Manager : Um and I I I s so I suppose one um {disfmarker} could make it so desirable that if people lose it they immediately go out and buy another one . </s> Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} </s> User Interface : {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : Anyway , sorry , carry on . Do you want to just carry on with {disfmarker} </s> Marketing : Oh no </s> Project Manager : or {disfmarker} </s> Marketing : I I interrupted you , </s> Project Manager : no no , no uh b I was in the middle of in the middle of your report there . {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : sorry {vocalsound} . Oh okay . Um well , I was just kinda wrapping up there . Yeah , </s> Project Manager : Mm okay . {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : I was thinking um , yeah , maybe such things are relevant . We could make things much more f I think the the eighty percent of people would spend more on uh a remote uh that looks better , combined with uh decrease the {disfmarker} or take out the limited functio functions that we don't really use much . {gap} alright take out teletext , but as for channel settings and stuff it might it might um turn people somewhe peop some people that want the whole functionality away . But , since {disfmarker} if we're marketing a more kind of fashionable approach then it'd {disfmarker} it would be fashion and fashion over practicality . </s> Project Manager : Mm-hmm . S s we could {disfmarker} we could make it dual function {gap} voice recognition and {gap} still have buttons on it um </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} Oh , we could , yeah . We c yeah , </s> Project Manager : 'cause we're {disfmarker} </s> Marketing : we could even have it as like a {disfmarker} yeah the buttons control this and the voice functions control the f things that you would do all the time , so . </s> Project Manager : {vocalsound} Certainly could . Yeah , yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : Mm . </s> Marketing : So uh yeah , if we could uh {disfmarker} power on and channel selection and and volume selection , wouldn't have to really {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : {gap} The {disfmarker} I mean the the advantage of doing away the buttons altogether is it makes the thing cheaper . </s> Marketing : Yeah and probably it would look better as well . </s> Project Manager : No , it cou certainly opens up the possibility for making it uh , you know , visually very distinctive . </s> Marketing : Yeah . yeah . </s> Project Manager : Um 'cause you know , it does not have to be a oblong box . </s> Industrial Designer : Mm . </s> Marketing : Lined with numbered buttons and {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : Mm , yeah . Okay , who {disfmarker} sorry , have you have you finished there Andy ? </s> Marketing : Uh yeah , yeah , that's everything . </s> Project Manager : Yep , yep . Um {vocalsound} given that we've already had a extensive discussion uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} . </s> Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} </s> User Interface : {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} </s> User Interface : Okay well , I can do mine . </s> Industrial Designer : Hmm . </s> Marketing : Do you want the cable ? </s> User Interface : Yeah , let's see if I can make this work .

And keep the v volume selection and channel selection very easily {disfmarker} </s> User Interface : It could be {disfmarker} oh uh I was just gonna say uh maybe like the flip phones that they use ? </s> Industrial Designer : Mm . </s> User Interface : Have you seen the new mo mobile phones </s> Project Manager : {vocalsound} Yeah . </s> User Interface : that flip out and they have the like texting , and then the numbers on one side , </s> Marketing : Oh yeah . </s> User Interface : so </s> Project Manager : Mm . </s> User Interface : you could have the most {vocalsound} used buttons on top and flip it out or something . </s> Project Manager : Hmm , hmm . </s> Industrial Designer : Mm . </s> Marketing : Yeah , like the one that like slides back </s> Project Manager : Uh . Should we actually bite the bullet here ? </s> Marketing : and the buttons are concealed underneath . </s> User Interface : Yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : Mm . </s> Project Manager : If people really don't use those buttons to any extent at all um {vocalsound} remove them altogether . </s> Marketing : Just remove them completely ? </s> Project Manager : We we could actually have we could actually have a remote control with um {disfmarker} </s> User Interface : That might be the {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : I wonder whether we could get the remote control with no buttons at all if we went for voice recognition , given that um the {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Um now the the age structure we were looking at {disfmarker} um I mean w we had usage by age structure , what we didn't have was what proportion of people using remotes were in those particular age groups . Now do we know whether they {disfmarker} </s> Marketing : Uh yeah . </s> Project Manager : Forty {disfmarker} no sorry {disfmarker} for forty five to fifty five age group , uh to put myself right in the middle of it , um u use remote controls to a great extent . </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} </s> Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : Yes we {disfmarker} </s> Marketing : Um no this is for {disfmarker} pay more for speech recognition . </s> Project Manager : That would 've speech recogn right . So , we're looking at {disfmarker} um well again , we don't know the relative proportion {disfmarker} the relative numbers in the age groups . </s> Marketing : Yeah , that's true . </s> Project Manager : If we wanted something different , truly different , then the buttonless remote control w would be it . </s> Industrial Designer : P Well the only problem I can think of with that is if you've got a lot of people that don't wanna be bothered learning how to use new rem remote controls . If you just kind of take away everything that they're used to knowing , that's gonna be quite a change . </s> Project Manager : But if you just lift it up and say , channel one or B_B_C_ {disfmarker} </s> Industrial Designer : It might {disfmarker} </s> Marketing : Or even {disfmarker} I mean you could even just have it left on . </s> User Interface : Maybe i </s> Marketing : You could just put it down once on top your T_V_ and never have to {disfmarker} </s> User Interface : Yeah , have a big kind of like the satellite box or the cable box </s> Project Manager : {vocalsound} </s> User Interface : and have it just go on the T_V_ and then it doesn't matter where in the room you are , </s> Industrial Designer : Mm . </s> User Interface : you won't lose it . </s> Marketing : Yeah . </s> Project Manager : It c well it {disfmarker} I can I can see technical problems with that in terms of the , you know , the sound from the television , </s> Industrial Designer : Mm . </s> User Interface : No . </s> Project Manager : because if somebody actually on the television says uh uh , you know , I_T_V_ and you're watching B_B_C_ then then it might um change itself , </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} B_B_C_ one . {vocalsound} </s> Industrial Designer : Yeah . {vocalsound} </s> User Interface : {vocalsound} Oh . {vocalsound} </s> Industrial Designer : Yeah . </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : so it probably needs to be um {disfmarker} possibly actually need a button on it </s> User Interface : Yeah , that's true . </s> Project Manager : just to activate it . </s> Marketing : Oh yeah . </s> Project Manager : Or or something just to identify that you've lifted it up and it's use . And and then just say , oh I don't know , a thought and and then {disfmarker} </s> User Interface : Yeah . </s> Project Manager : uh I mean that that would certainly be uh truly different . {vocalsound} Um 'cause uh you know audio settings , nought point eight percent . I mean if they weren't there , {vocalsound} would people miss them ? </s> Marketing : Mm-mm . </s> Industrial Designer : But look at the importance of them . The volume settings . </s> Project Manager : {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : Relevance of two out of ten , </s> Project Manager : Vol volume , </s> Marketing : yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : Yeah . </s> Project Manager : yes um </s> Industrial Designer : They're not used often </s> Project Manager : th {vocalsound} </s> Industrial Designer : but they are quite important when they're used . </s> Project Manager : w we need to s identify things that {vocalsound} people actually need </s> Industrial Designer : Yeah . </s> Project Manager : and and it's a function of frequency and relevance . And um I would say ignoring ig ignoring power for the moment , um the channel and volume </s> Industrial Designer : Mm . </s> Project Manager : and th w w given given that we've been told to ignore teletext . Uh channel and volume are the only ones that </s> Marketing : Yeah . </s> Project Manager : {vocalsound} uh would appear to be essential . </s> Marketing : Stand out . </s> Project Manager : Um . So {disfmarker} if we can design something that that looks interesting , know , or looks different , um incorporates the the logo and and the colours and um we can still have our interchangeable fascias even if it's {gap} the yellow and grey , um and uh I dunno , buttons or or buttons as an option . </s> Marketing : Uh I just had a thought actually , sorry to interrupt . </s> Project Manager : Do , please . </s> Marketing : Uh you were saying about um it could {disfmarker} technical problems of like uh someone on the television saying a channel number and it changed {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : Mm-hmm . </s> Marketing : we could maybe have like an activation word . </s> Project Manager : You cer certainly could . </s> Marketing : 'Cause I've seen I've seen this used on computers before , where you just {disfmarker} you address the remote , </s> Project Manager : {vocalsound} Depe uh i depends whether um {disfmarker} </s> Industrial Designer : Mm . </s> Marketing : you address the computer , and then give it a command . </s> Project Manager : if we want to make this so simple that anybody can walk into the room and lift it up and say </s> Marketing : Oh I see . Oh yeah , I see . </s> Project Manager : B_B_C_ one . Um okay , I mean you could print {disfmarker} actually print it on the uh </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} Mm-hmm , yeah . </s> Project Manager : device itself . Um . </s> Marketing : I mean I'm just thinking of the point of view of peop you could still like lose this remote . </s> Project Manager : S th this I th {vocalsound} that's always gonna be a problem I think . </s> Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : Mm . </s> Project Manager : Um and I I I s so I suppose one um {disfmarker} could make it so desirable that if people lose it they immediately go out and buy another one . </s> Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} </s> User Interface : {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : Anyway , sorry , carry on . Do you want to just carry on with {disfmarker} </s> Marketing : Oh no </s> Project Manager : or {disfmarker} </s> Marketing : I I interrupted you , </s> Project Manager : no no , no uh b I was in the middle of in the middle of your report there . {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : sorry {vocalsound} . Oh okay . Um well , I was just kinda wrapping up there . Yeah , </s> Project Manager : Mm okay . {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : I was thinking um , yeah , maybe such things are relevant . We could make things much more f I think the the eighty percent of people would spend more on uh a remote uh that looks better , combined with uh decrease the {disfmarker} or take out the limited functio functions that we don't really use much . {gap} alright take out teletext , but as for channel settings and stuff it might it might um turn people somewhe peop some people that want the whole functionality away . But , since {disfmarker} if we're marketing a more kind of fashionable approach then it'd {disfmarker} it would be fashion and fashion over practicality . </s> Project Manager : Mm-hmm . S s we could {disfmarker} we could make it dual function {gap} voice recognition and {gap} still have buttons on it um </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} Oh , we could , yeah . We c yeah , </s> Project Manager : 'cause we're {disfmarker} </s> Marketing : we could even have it as like a {disfmarker} yeah the buttons control this and the voice functions control the f things that you would do all the time , so . </s> Project Manager : {vocalsound} Certainly could . Yeah , yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : Mm . </s> Marketing : So uh yeah , if we could uh {disfmarker} power on and channel selection and and volume selection , wouldn't have to really {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : {gap} The {disfmarker} I mean the the advantage of doing away the buttons altogether is it makes the thing cheaper . </s> Marketing : Yeah and probably it would look better as well . </s> Project Manager : No , it cou certainly opens up the possibility for making it uh , you know , visually very distinctive . </s> Marketing : Yeah . yeah . </s> Project Manager : Um 'cause you know , it does not have to be a oblong box . </s> Industrial Designer : Mm . </s> Marketing : Lined with numbered buttons and {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : Mm , yeah . Okay , who {disfmarker} sorry , have you have you finished there Andy ? </s> Marketing : Uh yeah , yeah , that's everything . </s> Project Manager : Yep , yep . Um {vocalsound} given that we've already had a extensive discussion uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} . </s> Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} </s> User Interface : {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} </s> User Interface : Okay well , I can do mine . </s> Industrial Designer : Hmm . </s> Marketing : Do you want the cable ? </s> User Interface : Yeah , let's see if I can make this work . Um . </s> Industrial Designer : Oh , you have to hit like function and F_ something . </s> User Interface : Oh . </s> Marketing : F_ eight . </s> Industrial Designer : F_ eight . </s> User Interface : Is it doing {disfmarker} </s> Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Dunno . </s> Marketing : Uh , give it about twenty seconds , or so . </s> User Interface : Okay . </s> Project Manager : Ah , there we go . {vocalsound} </s> Industrial Designer : Oh yeah , it's going . </s> User Interface : Oh okay . {vocalsound} Okay , so this is just about the technical functions . </s> Project Manager : Alright . </s> User Interface : So the method , I looked online for examples of other similar products and then just kind of was trying to brainstorm some possible design ideas and um identify what the necessary things are , what people are {disfmarker} what you really wanna have a remote control do . Um and then there are two different kinds that I found . There's a user centred one and an engineering centred one which I will have pictures of and then we kinda have to decide which one this should be . </s> Project Manager : Mm-hmm . </s> User Interface : {vocalsound} So these are the two different ones . This one um {disfmarker} this is the user centred , it has uh quite a few mm uh um fewer buttons </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} </s> User Interface : and then this is the engineering centred , which has a lot more buttons , </s> Project Manager : Mm-hmm . </s> User Interface : and probably this is one that people complain about , about having too many buttons that you don't use . So basically , what a remote control is is you {disfmarker} it's to send messages to the television set , you know , turn on , off , switch the channels and the volume and things such as that . And so for this product it's gonna be television only , and then it has to have the uh logos for the company and the colours . And so , for my personal preferences , I think this one is easier to use and has quite a {disfmarker} you know , fewer buttons . Um we want something that sends messages easily to the television and I was kind of wondering about this example that they have . It looks kind of narrow at the top , and I was thinking maybe if it were wider at the top , </s> Project Manager : Mm , yeah . </s> User Interface : then that would be easier . Um {vocalsound} and so we have to decide what's gonna make our product different . E the unique style , maybe have it light up so it's visible in the dark , um the changeable face-plates , and the lighting up and visible I was {disfmarker} when we were talking about havi losing it , maybe to have a button on the television that you press and it {disfmarker} maybe if it makes a noise or lights up or something like that , so it's easier to find if someone has hidden under the couch or something like that . So that's my presentation . Yeah .",

    "article": "Marketing : Uh I don't mind . {gap} </s> Project Manager : P fine . </s> Marketing : Uh can I steal the cable ? </s> Project Manager : Oh sorry , you can indeed . </s> Marketing : Cheers . </s> Project Manager : {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} I got a {disfmarker} how do I start there ? </s> Project Manager : Oh , if you click on the um uh the one that that looks like a projection screen , no the one to the right of that . That one . </s> Marketing : That one . Cool . Well these are functionality requirements from the {disfmarker} our our guys down in the the research lab . Took hundred people and covered all the aspects of what um is needed by people and what they want to see . Um {vocalsound} everything kinda from functionality and how individual functions are {disfmarker} how mu how how often they're used and how much their necessary and stuff . And general opinions about current current remotes . See that , as we kinda noticed , seventy five percent of people find their remote controls ugly . So some kind of a new style should be incorporated that's less ugly {vocalsound} . Uh along with um looking less ugly , if it looks better , eighty percent of people said they'd spend more money on it . Which is a a plus for us , if we can make it look better , it'd be uh more cost effective and we can put the price up . Current remote controls do not match the operating behaviour of the user . I can empl I kinda take that to mean as um {vocalsound} they they don't uh {disfmarker} they , yeah , they only use {disfmarker} they only work for the television or yeah like as in in my flat I've got six remote controls for a stereo system , a digital box , a D_V_D_ player , a video player and T_V_ . If it was uh {disfmarker} I mean th my behaviour is to use multiple things at the same time and multiple remotes aren't really matched well to my behaviour . {vocalsound} Uh again , seventy five percent is {disfmarker} seventy five percent of users say they zap a lot . I took to mean that they just {disfmarker} they use it a lot , they use it regularly rather than standing up and manually change channels or volume {gap} . {vocalsound} And uh yeah , uh I think the big issue is fifty percent users only use ten percent of the buttons , 'cause uh wh if we got a remote that like {disfmarker} well we'll have some buttons taken off by the lack of teletext , but uh oh and we're going to see uh on the {disfmarker} uh that some of the functions like audio settings aren't h hardly ever used and used very {disfmarker} aren't considered relevant by the user . So I think maybe fewer buttons , which also make the design look sleeker , I dunno . Uh um yeah and uh frustrations of like people losing remote control . </s> Project Manager : Mm . </s> Marketing : I dunno maybe some kind of system of you press a button on the T_V_ or maybe that's b it would have to incorporate {gap} , but like some kind of system where you can f use something else to find the remote control . Maybe like it'll beep or something . And um , yep , the uh time taken to learn new remote controls is {disfmarker} Uh don't want to make it too complicated , easy to use for uh new {disfmarker} like first time users and stuff . And uh repetitive strain injury , I suppose we should make it more comfortable and make ma possibly even use {disfmarker} have to make it , yeah , fewer buttons , like I was saying about the whole mice {disfmarker} the mouse idea of it feels more comfortable . </s> Project Manager : Mm . </s> Marketing : Maybe don't even have to hold it as such . </s> Project Manager : Gosh , must be some telly addicts out there if they get R_S_I_ from their television remote , is all I can say . </s> Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} </s> User Interface : {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : But uh yeah . It also asked um if we would {disfmarker} if people would pay more for speech recognition </s> Project Manager : {vocalsound} {gap} </s> Marketing : and younger people say they would . And uh there was another section on our {disfmarker} on the report for uh L_C_D_ displays , but the data wasn't there , so . I don't actually know what the results for that were , </s> Project Manager : Mm . Right . Mm . </s> Marketing : so . {vocalsound} May be incrementally emitting , but yeah . </s> Project Manager : Yeah , I must say that um the uh {disfmarker} I c can't remember what {vocalsound} um f you know phone service I was using the other day , but that had sorta speech recognition which worked uh remarkably well , so that is indeed a uh um a thought </s> Marketing : And uh {vocalsound} it would cut out the R_S_I_ as well if you {disfmarker} {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : and it it cuts out uh {disfmarker} I was was gonna say , you can't get a lot of R_S_I_ , </s> Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : j just get jaw ache . Okay , sorry . {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : Yeah , um {disfmarker} oh yeah , so possibly the speech recognition is possibly something could add into the design . Oh , I've got some other things I couldn't fit onto this presentation . Um . You see this okay ? Almost {disfmarker} no ? It's {disfmarker} sorry it's a bit {gap} . I'll read out to you . Uh functionality , uh like people's opinions on functionality , the relevance to the remote and how often they're used . So um like the power . Using the using the d swi the power switch to switch on T_V_ is a high relevance of nine , but it's not frequently used . You see what I mean ? </s> Project Manager : Yeah . {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : Whereas channel selection , which is very high relevance </s> Project Manager : Mm-hmm . </s> Marketing : is used the most . So m we can maybe even start to cut down on {disfmarker} or I was possibly even thinking of a design that maybe some of the buttons are hidden from everyday use . Maybe like uh a folding ledge or something . So that we can maybe go into the channel settings and the audio settings , </s> Industrial Designer : Mm . </s> Marketing : which are low relevance </s> Project Manager : {vocalsound} Mm-hmm . I mean {disfmarker} </s> Marketing : and rarely used . And keep the v volume selection and channel selection very easily {disfmarker} </s> User Interface : It could be {disfmarker} oh uh I was just gonna say uh maybe like the flip phones that they use ? </s> Industrial Designer : Mm . </s> User Interface : Have you seen the new mo mobile phones </s> Project Manager : {vocalsound} Yeah . </s> User Interface : that flip out and they have the like texting , and then the numbers on one side , </s> Marketing : Oh yeah . </s> User Interface : so </s> Project Manager : Mm . </s> User Interface : you could have the most {vocalsound} used buttons on top and flip it out or something . </s> Project Manager : Hmm , hmm . </s> Industrial Designer : Mm . </s> Marketing : Yeah , like the one that like slides back </s> Project Manager : Uh .

This one um {disfmarker} this is the user centred , it has uh quite a few mm uh um fewer buttons </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} </s> User Interface : and then this is the engineering centred , which has a lot more buttons , </s> Project Manager : Mm-hmm . </s> User Interface : and probably this is one that people complain about , about having too many buttons that you don't use . So basically , what a remote control is is you {disfmarker} it's to send messages to the television set , you know , turn on , off , switch the channels and the volume and things such as that . And so for this product it's gonna be television only , and then it has to have the uh logos for the company and the colours . And so , for my personal preferences , I think this one is easier to use and has quite a {disfmarker} you know , fewer buttons . Um we want something that sends messages easily to the television and I was kind of wondering about this example that they have . It looks kind of narrow at the top , and I was thinking maybe if it were wider at the top , </s> Project Manager : Mm , yeah . </s> User Interface : then that would be easier . Um {vocalsound} and so we have to decide what's gonna make our product different . E the unique style , maybe have it light up so it's visible in the dark , um the changeable face-plates , and the lighting up and visible I was {disfmarker} when we were talking about havi losing it , maybe to have a button on the television that you press and it {disfmarker} maybe if it makes a noise or lights up or something like that , so it's easier to find if someone has hidden under the couch or something like that . So that's my presentation . Yeah .",

That one . </s> Marketing : That one . Cool . Well these are functionality requirements from the {disfmarker} our our guys down in the the research lab . Took hundred people and covered all the aspects of what um is needed by people and what they want to see . Um {vocalsound} everything kinda from functionality and how individual functions are {disfmarker} how mu how how often they're used and how much their necessary and stuff . And general opinions about current current remotes . See that , as we kinda noticed , seventy five percent of people find their remote controls ugly . So some kind of a new style should be incorporated that's less ugly {vocalsound} . Uh along with um looking less ugly , if it looks better , eighty percent of people said they'd spend more money on it . Which is a a plus for us , if we can make it look better , it'd be uh more cost effective and we can put the price up . Current remote controls do not match the operating behaviour of the user . I can empl I kinda take that to mean as um {vocalsound} they they don't uh {disfmarker} they , yeah , they only use {disfmarker} they only work for the television or yeah like as in in my flat I've got six remote controls for a stereo system , a digital box , a D_V_D_ player , a video player and T_V_ . If it was uh {disfmarker} I mean th my behaviour is to use multiple things at the same time and multiple remotes aren't really matched well to my behaviour . {vocalsound} Uh again , seventy five percent is {disfmarker} seventy five percent of users say they zap a lot . I took to mean that they just {disfmarker} they use it a lot , they use it regularly rather than standing up and manually change channels or volume {gap} . {vocalsound} And uh yeah , uh I think the big issue is fifty percent users only use ten percent of the buttons , 'cause uh wh if we got a remote that like {disfmarker} well we'll have some buttons taken off by the lack of teletext , but uh oh and we're going to see uh on the {disfmarker} uh that some of the functions like audio settings aren't h hardly ever used and used very {disfmarker} aren't considered relevant by the user . So I think maybe fewer buttons , which also make the design look sleeker , I dunno . Uh um yeah and uh frustrations of like people losing remote control . </s> Project Manager : Mm . </s> Marketing : I dunno maybe some kind of system of you press a button on the T_V_ or maybe that's b it would have to incorporate {gap} , but like some kind of system where you can f use something else to find the remote control . Maybe like it'll beep or something . And um , yep , the uh time taken to learn new remote controls is {disfmarker} Uh don't want to make it too complicated , easy to use for uh new {disfmarker} like first time users and stuff . And uh repetitive strain injury , I suppose we should make it more comfortable and make ma possibly even use {disfmarker} have to make it , yeah , fewer buttons , like I was saying about the whole mice {disfmarker} the mouse idea of it feels more comfortable . </s> Project Manager : Mm . </s> Marketing : Maybe don't even have to hold it as such . </s> Project Manager : Gosh , must be some telly addicts out there if they get R_S_I_ from their television remote , is all I can say . </s> Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} </s> User Interface : {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : But uh yeah . It also asked um if we would {disfmarker} if people would pay more for speech recognition </s> Project Manager : {vocalsound} {gap} </s> Marketing : and younger people say they would .

Mm . </s> Marketing : so . {vocalsound} May be incrementally emitting , but yeah . </s> Project Manager : Yeah , I must say that um the uh {disfmarker} I c can't remember what {vocalsound} um f you know phone service I was using the other day , but that had sorta speech recognition which worked uh remarkably well , so that is indeed a uh um a thought </s> Marketing : And uh {vocalsound} it would cut out the R_S_I_ as well if you {disfmarker} {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : and it it cuts out uh {disfmarker} I was was gonna say , you can't get a lot of R_S_I_ , </s> Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : j just get jaw ache . Okay , sorry . {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : Yeah , um {disfmarker} oh yeah , so possibly the speech recognition is possibly something could add into the design . Oh , I've got some other things I couldn't fit onto this presentation . Um . You see this okay ? Almost {disfmarker} no ? It's {disfmarker} sorry it's a bit {gap} . I'll read out to you . Uh functionality , uh like people's opinions on functionality , the relevance to the remote and how often they're used . So um like the power . Using the using the d swi the power switch to switch on T_V_ is a high relevance of nine , but it's not frequently used . You see what I mean ? </s> Project Manager : Yeah . {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : Whereas channel selection , which is very high relevance </s> Project Manager : Mm-hmm . </s> Marketing : is used the most . So m we can maybe even start to cut down on {disfmarker} or I was possibly even thinking of a design that maybe some of the buttons are hidden from everyday use . Maybe like uh a folding ledge or something . So that we can maybe go into the channel settings and the audio settings , </s> Industrial Designer : Mm . </s> Marketing : which are low relevance </s> Project Manager : {vocalsound} Mm-hmm . I mean {disfmarker} </s> Marketing : and rarely used . And keep the v volume selection and channel selection very easily {disfmarker} </s> User Interface : It could be {disfmarker} oh uh I was just gonna say uh maybe like the flip phones that they use ? </s> Industrial Designer : Mm . </s> User Interface : Have you seen the new mo mobile phones </s> Project Manager : {vocalsound} Yeah . </s> User Interface : that flip out and they have the like texting , and then the numbers on one side , </s> Marketing : Oh yeah . </s> User Interface : so </s> Project Manager : Mm . </s> User Interface : you could have the most {vocalsound} used buttons on top and flip it out or something . </s> Project Manager : Hmm , hmm . </s> Industrial Designer : Mm . </s> Marketing : Yeah , like the one that like slides back </s> Project Manager : Uh . Should we actually bite the bullet here ? </s> Marketing : and the buttons are concealed underneath . </s> User Interface : Yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : Mm . </s> Project Manager : If people really don't use those buttons to any extent at all um {vocalsound} remove them altogether . </s> Marketing : Just remove them completely ? </s> Project Manager : We we could actually have we could actually have a remote control with um {disfmarker} </s> User Interface : That might be the {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : I wonder whether we could get the remote control with no buttons at all if we went for voice recognition , given that um the {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Um now the the age structure we were looking at {disfmarker} um I mean w we had usage by age structure , what we didn't have was what proportion of people using remotes were in those particular age groups . Now do we know whether they {disfmarker} </s> Marketing : Uh yeah . </s> Project Manager : Forty {disfmarker} no sorry {disfmarker} for forty five to fifty five age group , uh to put myself right in the middle of it , um u use remote controls to a great extent . </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} </s> Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : Yes we {disfmarker} </s> Marketing : Um no this is for {disfmarker} pay more for speech recognition . </s> Project Manager : That would 've speech recogn right . So , we're looking at {disfmarker} um well again , we don't know the relative proportion {disfmarker} the relative numbers in the age groups . </s> Marketing : Yeah , that's true . </s> Project Manager : If we wanted something different , truly different , then the buttonless remote control w would be it . </s> Industrial Designer : P Well the only problem I can think of with that is if you've got a lot of people that don't wanna be bothered learning how to use new rem remote controls . If you just kind of take away everything that they're used to knowing , that's gonna be quite a change . </s> Project Manager : But if you just lift it up and say , channel one or B_B_C_ {disfmarker} </s> Industrial Designer : It might {disfmarker} </s> Marketing : Or even {disfmarker} I mean you could even just have it left on . </s> User Interface : Maybe i </s> Marketing : You could just put it down once on top your T_V_ and never have to {disfmarker} </s> User Interface : Yeah , have a big kind of like the satellite box or the cable box </s> Project Manager : {vocalsound} </s> User Interface : and have it just go on the T_V_ and then it doesn't matter where in the room you are , </s> Industrial Designer : Mm . </s> User Interface : you won't lose it . </s> Marketing : Yeah . </s> Project Manager : It c well it {disfmarker} I can I can see technical problems with that in terms of the , you know , the sound from the television , </s> Industrial Designer : Mm . </s> User Interface : No . </s> Project Manager : because if somebody actually on the television says uh uh , you know , I_T_V_ and you're watching B_B_C_ then then it might um change itself , </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} B_B_C_ one . {vocalsound} </s> Industrial Designer : Yeah . {vocalsound} </s> User Interface : {vocalsound} Oh . {vocalsound} </s> Industrial Designer : Yeah . </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : so it probably needs to be um {disfmarker} possibly actually need a button on it </s> User Interface : Yeah , that's true . </s> Project Manager : just to activate it . </s> Marketing : Oh yeah . </s> Project Manager : Or or something just to identify that you've lifted it up and it's use . And and then just say , oh I don't know , a thought and and then {disfmarker} </s> User Interface : Yeah . </s> Project Manager : uh I mean that that would certainly be uh truly different . {vocalsound} Um 'cause uh you know audio settings , nought point eight percent . I mean if they weren't there , {vocalsound} would people miss them ? </s> Marketing : Mm-mm . </s> Industrial Designer : But look at the importance of them . The volume settings . </s> Project Manager : {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : Relevance of two out of ten , </s> Project Manager : Vol volume , </s> Marketing : yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : Yeah . </s> Project Manager : yes um </s> Industrial Designer : They're not used often </s> Project Manager : th {vocalsound} </s> Industrial Designer : but they are quite important when they're used . </s> Project Manager : w we need to s identify things that {vocalsound} people actually need </s> Industrial Designer : Yeah . </s> Project Manager : and and it's a function of frequency and relevance . And um I would say ignoring ig ignoring power for the moment , um the channel and volume </s> Industrial Designer : Mm . </s> Project Manager : and th w w given given that we've been told to ignore teletext . Uh channel and volume are the only ones that </s> Marketing : Yeah . </s> Project Manager : {vocalsound} uh would appear to be essential . </s> Marketing : Stand out . </s> Project Manager : Um . So {disfmarker} if we can design something that that looks interesting , know , or looks different , um incorporates the the logo and and the colours and um we can still have our interchangeable fascias even if it's {gap} the yellow and grey , um and uh I dunno , buttons or or buttons as an option . </s> Marketing : Uh I just had a thought actually , sorry to interrupt . </s> Project Manager : Do , please . </s> Marketing : Uh you were saying about um it could {disfmarker} technical problems of like uh someone on the television saying a channel number and it changed {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : Mm-hmm . </s> Marketing : we could maybe have like an activation word . </s> Project Manager : You cer certainly could . </s> Marketing : 'Cause I've seen I've seen this used on computers before , where you just {disfmarker} you address the remote , </s> Project Manager : {vocalsound} Depe uh i depends whether um {disfmarker} </s> Industrial Designer : Mm . </s> Marketing : you address the computer , and then give it a command . </s> Project Manager : if we want to make this so simple that anybody can walk into the room and lift it up and say </s> Marketing : Oh I see . Oh yeah , I see . </s> Project Manager : B_B_C_ one . Um okay , I mean you could print {disfmarker} actually print it on the uh </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} Mm-hmm , yeah . </s> Project Manager : device itself . Um . </s> Marketing : I mean I'm just thinking of the point of view of peop you could still like lose this remote . </s> Project Manager : S th this I th {vocalsound} that's always gonna be a problem I think . </s> Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : Mm . </s> Project Manager : Um and I I I s so I suppose one um {disfmarker} could make it so desirable that if people lose it they immediately go out and buy another one . </s> Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} </s> User Interface : {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : Anyway , sorry , carry on . Do you want to just carry on with {disfmarker} </s> Marketing : Oh no </s> Project Manager : or {disfmarker} </s> Marketing : I I interrupted you , </s> Project Manager : no no , no uh b I was in the middle of in the middle of your report there . {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : sorry {vocalsound} . Oh okay . Um well , I was just kinda wrapping up there . Yeah , </s> Project Manager : Mm okay . {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : I was thinking um , yeah , maybe such things are relevant . We could make things much more f I think the the eighty percent of people would spend more on uh a remote uh that looks better , combined with uh decrease the {disfmarker} or take out the limited functio functions that we don't really use much . {gap} alright take out teletext , but as for channel settings and stuff it might it might um turn people somewhe peop some people that want the whole functionality away . But , since {disfmarker} if we're marketing a more kind of fashionable approach then it'd {disfmarker} it would be fashion and fashion over practicality . </s> Project Manager : Mm-hmm . S s we could {disfmarker} we could make it dual function {gap} voice recognition and {gap} still have buttons on it um </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} Oh , we could , yeah . We c yeah , </s> Project Manager : 'cause we're {disfmarker} </s> Marketing : we could even have it as like a {disfmarker} yeah the buttons control this and the voice functions control the f things that you would do all the time , so . </s> Project Manager : {vocalsound} Certainly could . Yeah , yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : Mm . </s> Marketing : So uh yeah , if we could uh {disfmarker} power on and channel selection and and volume selection , wouldn't have to really {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : {gap} The {disfmarker} I mean the the advantage of doing away the buttons altogether is it makes the thing cheaper . </s> Marketing : Yeah and probably it would look better as well . </s> Project Manager : No , it cou certainly opens up the possibility for making it uh , you know , visually very distinctive . </s> Marketing : Yeah . yeah . </s> Project Manager : Um 'cause you know , it does not have to be a oblong box . </s> Industrial Designer : Mm . </s> Marketing : Lined with numbered buttons and {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : Mm , yeah . Okay , who {disfmarker} sorry , have you have you finished there Andy ? </s> Marketing : Uh yeah , yeah , that's everything . </s> Project Manager : Yep , yep . Um {vocalsound} given that we've already had a extensive discussion uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} . </s> Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} </s> User Interface : {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} </s> User Interface : Okay well , I can do mine . </s> Industrial Designer : Hmm . </s> Marketing : Do you want the cable ? </s> User Interface : Yeah , let's see if I can make this work . Um . </s> Industrial Designer : Oh , you have to hit like function and F_ something . </s> User Interface : Oh . </s> Marketing : F_ eight . </s> Industrial Designer : F_ eight . </s> User Interface : Is it doing {disfmarker} </s> Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Dunno . </s> Marketing : Uh , give it about twenty seconds , or so . </s> User Interface : Okay . </s> Project Manager : Ah , there we go . {vocalsound} </s> Industrial Designer : Oh yeah , it's going . </s> User Interface : Oh okay . {vocalsound} Okay , so this is just about the technical functions . </s> Project Manager : Alright . </s> User Interface : So the method , I looked online for examples of other similar products and then just kind of was trying to brainstorm some possible design ideas and um identify what the necessary things are , what people are {disfmarker} what you really wanna have a remote control do . Um and then there are two different kinds that I found . There's a user centred one and an engineering centred one which I will have pictures of and then we kinda have to decide which one this should be . </s> Project Manager : Mm-hmm . </s> User Interface : {vocalsound} So these are the two different ones . This one um {disfmarker} this is the user centred , it has uh quite a few mm uh um fewer buttons </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} </s> User Interface : and then this is the engineering centred , which has a lot more buttons , </s> Project Manager : Mm-hmm . </s> User Interface : and probably this is one that people complain about , about having too many buttons that you don't use .

If you just kind of take away everything that they're used to knowing , that's gonna be quite a change . </s> Project Manager : But if you just lift it up and say , channel one or B_B_C_ {disfmarker} </s> Industrial Designer : It might {disfmarker} </s> Marketing : Or even {disfmarker} I mean you could even just have it left on . </s> User Interface : Maybe i </s> Marketing : You could just put it down once on top your T_V_ and never have to {disfmarker} </s> User Interface : Yeah , have a big kind of like the satellite box or the cable box </s> Project Manager : {vocalsound} </s> User Interface : and have it just go on the T_V_ and then it doesn't matter where in the room you are , </s> Industrial Designer : Mm . </s> User Interface : you won't lose it . </s> Marketing : Yeah . </s> Project Manager : It c well it {disfmarker} I can I can see technical problems with that in terms of the , you know , the sound from the television , </s> Industrial Designer : Mm . </s> User Interface : No . </s> Project Manager : because if somebody actually on the television says uh uh , you know , I_T_V_ and you're watching B_B_C_ then then it might um change itself , </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} B_B_C_ one . {vocalsound} </s> Industrial Designer : Yeah . {vocalsound} </s> User Interface : {vocalsound} Oh . {vocalsound} </s> Industrial Designer : Yeah . </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : so it probably needs to be um {disfmarker} possibly actually need a button on it </s> User Interface : Yeah , that's true . </s> Project Manager : just to activate it . </s> Marketing : Oh yeah . </s> Project Manager : Or or something just to identify that you've lifted it up and it's use . And and then just say , oh I don't know , a thought and and then {disfmarker} </s> User Interface : Yeah . </s> Project Manager : uh I mean that that would certainly be uh truly different . {vocalsound} Um 'cause uh you know audio settings , nought point eight percent . I mean if they weren't there , {vocalsound} would people miss them ? </s> Marketing : Mm-mm . </s> Industrial Designer : But look at the importance of them . The volume settings . </s> Project Manager : {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : Relevance of two out of ten , </s> Project Manager : Vol volume , </s> Marketing : yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : Yeah . </s> Project Manager : yes um </s> Industrial Designer : They're not used often </s> Project Manager : th {vocalsound} </s> Industrial Designer : but they are quite important when they're used . </s> Project Manager : w we need to s identify things that {vocalsound} people actually need </s> Industrial Designer : Yeah . </s> Project Manager : and and it's a function of frequency and relevance . And um I would say ignoring ig ignoring power for the moment , um the channel and volume </s> Industrial Designer : Mm . </s> Project Manager : and th w w given given that we've been told to ignore teletext . Uh channel and volume are the only ones that </s> Marketing : Yeah . </s> Project Manager : {vocalsound} uh would appear to be essential . </s> Marketing : Stand out . </s> Project Manager : Um . So {disfmarker} if we can design something that that looks interesting , know , or looks different , um incorporates the the logo and and the colours and um we can still have our interchangeable fascias even if it's {gap} the yellow and grey , um and uh I dunno , buttons or or buttons as an option . </s> Marketing : Uh I just had a thought actually , sorry to interrupt . </s> Project Manager : Do , please . </s> Marketing : Uh you were saying about um it could {disfmarker} technical problems of like uh someone on the television saying a channel number and it changed {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : Mm-hmm . </s> Marketing : we could maybe have like an activation word . </s> Project Manager : You cer certainly could . </s> Marketing : 'Cause I've seen I've seen this used on computers before , where you just {disfmarker} you address the remote , </s> Project Manager : {vocalsound} Depe uh i depends whether um {disfmarker} </s> Industrial Designer : Mm . </s> Marketing : you address the computer , and then give it a command . </s> Project Manager : if we want to make this so simple that anybody can walk into the room and lift it up and say </s> Marketing : Oh I see . Oh yeah , I see . </s> Project Manager : B_B_C_ one . Um okay , I mean you could print {disfmarker} actually print it on the uh </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} Mm-hmm , yeah . </s> Project Manager : device itself . Um . </s> Marketing : I mean I'm just thinking of the point of view of peop you could still like lose this remote . </s> Project Manager : S th this I th {vocalsound} that's always gonna be a problem I think . </s> Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : Mm . </s> Project Manager : Um and I I I s so I suppose one um {disfmarker} could make it so desirable that if people lose it they immediately go out and buy another one . </s> Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} </s> User Interface : {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : Anyway , sorry , carry on . Do you want to just carry on with {disfmarker} </s> Marketing : Oh no </s> Project Manager : or {disfmarker} </s> Marketing : I I interrupted you , </s> Project Manager : no no , no uh b I was in the middle of in the middle of your report there . {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : sorry {vocalsound} . Oh okay . Um well , I was just kinda wrapping up there . Yeah , </s> Project Manager : Mm okay . {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : I was thinking um , yeah , maybe such things are relevant . We could make things much more f I think the the eighty percent of people would spend more on uh a remote uh that looks better , combined with uh decrease the {disfmarker} or take out the limited functio functions that we don't really use much . {gap} alright take out teletext , but as for channel settings and stuff it might it might um turn people somewhe peop some people that want the whole functionality away . But , since {disfmarker} if we're marketing a more kind of fashionable approach then it'd {disfmarker} it would be fashion and fashion over practicality . </s> Project Manager : Mm-hmm . S s we could {disfmarker} we could make it dual function {gap} voice recognition and {gap} still have buttons on it um </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} Oh , we could , yeah . We c yeah , </s> Project Manager : 'cause we're {disfmarker} </s> Marketing : we could even have it as like a {disfmarker} yeah the buttons control this and the voice functions control the f things that you would do all the time , so . </s> Project Manager : {vocalsound} Certainly could . Yeah , yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : Mm . </s> Marketing : So uh yeah , if we could uh {disfmarker} power on and channel selection and and volume selection , wouldn't have to really {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : {gap} The {disfmarker} I mean the the advantage of doing away the buttons altogether is it makes the thing cheaper . </s> Marketing : Yeah and probably it would look better as well . </s> Project Manager : No , it cou certainly opens up the possibility for making it uh , you know , visually very distinctive . </s> Marketing : Yeah . yeah . </s> Project Manager : Um 'cause you know , it does not have to be a oblong box . </s> Industrial Designer : Mm . </s> Marketing : Lined with numbered buttons and {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : Mm , yeah . Okay , who {disfmarker} sorry , have you have you finished there Andy ? </s> Marketing : Uh yeah , yeah , that's everything . </s> Project Manager : Yep , yep . Um {vocalsound} given that we've already had a extensive discussion uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} . </s> Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} </s> User Interface : {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} </s> User Interface : Okay well , I can do mine . </s> Industrial Designer : Hmm . </s> Marketing : Do you want the cable ? </s> User Interface : Yeah , let's see if I can make this work . Um . </s> Industrial Designer : Oh , you have to hit like function and F_ something . </s> User Interface : Oh . </s> Marketing : F_ eight . </s> Industrial Designer : F_ eight . </s> User Interface : Is it doing {disfmarker} </s> Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Dunno . </s> Marketing : Uh , give it about twenty seconds , or so . </s> User Interface : Okay . </s> Project Manager : Ah , there we go . {vocalsound} </s> Industrial Designer : Oh yeah , it's going . </s> User Interface : Oh okay . {vocalsound} Okay , so this is just about the technical functions . </s> Project Manager : Alright . </s> User Interface : So the method , I looked online for examples of other similar products and then just kind of was trying to brainstorm some possible design ideas and um identify what the necessary things are , what people are {disfmarker} what you really wanna have a remote control do . Um and then there are two different kinds that I found . There's a user centred one and an engineering centred one which I will have pictures of and then we kinda have to decide which one this should be . </s> Project Manager : Mm-hmm . </s> User Interface : {vocalsound} So these are the two different ones . This one um {disfmarker} this is the user centred , it has uh quite a few mm uh um fewer buttons </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} </s> User Interface : and then this is the engineering centred , which has a lot more buttons , </s> Project Manager : Mm-hmm . </s> User Interface : and probably this is one that people complain about , about having too many buttons that you don't use . So basically , what a remote control is is you {disfmarker} it's to send messages to the television set , you know , turn on , off , switch the channels and the volume and things such as that . And so for this product it's gonna be television only , and then it has to have the uh logos for the company and the colours . And so , for my personal preferences , I think this one is easier to use and has quite a {disfmarker} you know , fewer buttons . Um we want something that sends messages easily to the television and I was kind of wondering about this example that they have . It looks kind of narrow at the top , and I was thinking maybe if it were wider at the top , </s> Project Manager : Mm , yeah . </s> User Interface : then that would be easier . Um {vocalsound} and so we have to decide what's gonna make our product different . E the unique style , maybe have it light up so it's visible in the dark , um the changeable face-plates , and the lighting up and visible I was {disfmarker} when we were talking about havi losing it , maybe to have a button on the television that you press and it {disfmarker} maybe if it makes a noise or lights up or something like that , so it's easier to find if someone has hidden under the couch or something like that . So that's my presentation . Yeah .",

    "article": "Marketing : Uh I don't mind . {gap} </s> Project Manager : P fine . </s> Marketing : Uh can I steal the cable ? </s> Project Manager : Oh sorry , you can indeed . </s> Marketing : Cheers . </s> Project Manager : {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} I got a {disfmarker} how do I start there ? </s> Project Manager : Oh , if you click on the um uh the one that that looks like a projection screen , no the one to the right of that . That one . </s> Marketing : That one . Cool . Well these are functionality requirements from the {disfmarker} our our guys down in the the research lab . Took hundred people and covered all the aspects of what um is needed by people and what they want to see . Um {vocalsound} everything kinda from functionality and how individual functions are {disfmarker} how mu how how often they're used and how much their necessary and stuff . And general opinions about current current remotes . See that , as we kinda noticed , seventy five percent of people find their remote controls ugly . So some kind of a new style should be incorporated that's less ugly {vocalsound} . Uh along with um looking less ugly , if it looks better , eighty percent of people said they'd spend more money on it . Which is a a plus for us , if we can make it look better , it'd be uh more cost effective and we can put the price up . Current remote controls do not match the operating behaviour of the user . I can empl I kinda take that to mean as um {vocalsound} they they don't uh {disfmarker} they , yeah , they only use {disfmarker} they only work for the television or yeah like as in in my flat I've got six remote controls for a stereo system , a digital box , a D_V_D_ player , a video player and T_V_ . If it was uh {disfmarker} I mean th my behaviour is to use multiple things at the same time and multiple remotes aren't really matched well to my behaviour . {vocalsound} Uh again , seventy five percent is {disfmarker} seventy five percent of users say they zap a lot . I took to mean that they just {disfmarker} they use it a lot , they use it regularly rather than standing up and manually change channels or volume {gap} . {vocalsound} And uh yeah , uh I think the big issue is fifty percent users only use ten percent of the buttons , 'cause uh wh if we got a remote that like {disfmarker} well we'll have some buttons taken off by the lack of teletext , but uh oh and we're going to see uh on the {disfmarker} uh that some of the functions like audio settings aren't h hardly ever used and used very {disfmarker} aren't considered relevant by the user . So I think maybe fewer buttons , which also make the design look sleeker , I dunno . Uh um yeah and uh frustrations of like people losing remote control . </s> Project Manager : Mm . </s> Marketing : I dunno maybe some kind of system of you press a button on the T_V_ or maybe that's b it would have to incorporate {gap} , but like some kind of system where you can f use something else to find the remote control . Maybe like it'll beep or something . And um , yep , the uh time taken to learn new remote controls is {disfmarker} Uh don't want to make it too complicated , easy to use for uh new {disfmarker} like first time users and stuff . And uh repetitive strain injury , I suppose we should make it more comfortable and make ma possibly even use {disfmarker} have to make it , yeah , fewer buttons , like I was saying about the whole mice {disfmarker} the mouse idea of it feels more comfortable . </s> Project Manager : Mm . </s> Marketing : Maybe don't even have to hold it as such . </s> Project Manager : Gosh , must be some telly addicts out there if they get R_S_I_ from their television remote , is all I can say . </s> Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} </s> User Interface : {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : But uh yeah . It also asked um if we would {disfmarker} if people would pay more for speech recognition </s> Project Manager : {vocalsound} {gap} </s> Marketing : and younger people say they would . And uh there was another section on our {disfmarker} on the report for uh L_C_D_ displays , but the data wasn't there , so . I don't actually know what the results for that were , </s> Project Manager : Mm . Right . Mm . </s> Marketing : so . {vocalsound} May be incrementally emitting , but yeah . </s> Project Manager : Yeah , I must say that um the uh {disfmarker} I c can't remember what {vocalsound} um f you know phone service I was using the other day , but that had sorta speech recognition which worked uh remarkably well , so that is indeed a uh um a thought </s> Marketing : And uh {vocalsound} it would cut out the R_S_I_ as well if you {disfmarker} {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : and it it cuts out uh {disfmarker} I was was gonna say , you can't get a lot of R_S_I_ , </s> Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : j just get jaw ache . Okay , sorry . {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : Yeah , um {disfmarker} oh yeah , so possibly the speech recognition is possibly something could add into the design . Oh , I've got some other things I couldn't fit onto this presentation . Um . You see this okay ? Almost {disfmarker} no ? It's {disfmarker} sorry it's a bit {gap} . I'll read out to you . Uh functionality , uh like people's opinions on functionality , the relevance to the remote and how often they're used . So um like the power . Using the using the d swi the power switch to switch on T_V_ is a high relevance of nine , but it's not frequently used . You see what I mean ? </s> Project Manager : Yeah . {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : Whereas channel selection , which is very high relevance </s> Project Manager : Mm-hmm . </s> Marketing : is used the most . So m we can maybe even start to cut down on {disfmarker} or I was possibly even thinking of a design that maybe some of the buttons are hidden from everyday use . Maybe like uh a folding ledge or something . So that we can maybe go into the channel settings and the audio settings , </s> Industrial Designer : Mm . </s> Marketing : which are low relevance </s> Project Manager : {vocalsound} Mm-hmm . I mean {disfmarker} </s> Marketing : and rarely used . And keep the v volume selection and channel selection very easily {disfmarker} </s> User Interface : It could be {disfmarker} oh uh I was just gonna say uh maybe like the flip phones that they use ? </s> Industrial Designer : Mm . </s> User Interface : Have you seen the new mo mobile phones </s> Project Manager : {vocalsound} Yeah . </s> User Interface : that flip out and they have the like texting , and then the numbers on one side , </s> Marketing : Oh yeah . </s> User Interface : so </s> Project Manager : Mm . </s> User Interface : you could have the most {vocalsound} used buttons on top and flip it out or something . </s> Project Manager : Hmm , hmm . </s> Industrial Designer : Mm . </s> Marketing : Yeah , like the one that like slides back </s> Project Manager : Uh . Should we actually bite the bullet here ? </s> Marketing : and the buttons are concealed underneath . </s> User Interface : Yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : Mm . </s> Project Manager : If people really don't use those buttons to any extent at all um {vocalsound} remove them altogether . </s> Marketing : Just remove them completely ? </s> Project Manager : We we could actually have we could actually have a remote control with um {disfmarker} </s> User Interface : That might be the {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : I wonder whether we could get the remote control with no buttons at all if we went for voice recognition , given that um the {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Um now the the age structure we were looking at {disfmarker} um I mean w we had usage by age structure , what we didn't have was what proportion of people using remotes were in those particular age groups . Now do we know whether they {disfmarker} </s> Marketing : Uh yeah . </s> Project Manager : Forty {disfmarker} no sorry {disfmarker} for forty five to fifty five age group , uh to put myself right in the middle of it , um u use remote controls to a great extent . </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} </s> Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : Yes we {disfmarker} </s> Marketing : Um no this is for {disfmarker} pay more for speech recognition . </s> Project Manager : That would 've speech recogn right . So , we're looking at {disfmarker} um well again , we don't know the relative proportion {disfmarker} the relative numbers in the age groups . </s> Marketing : Yeah , that's true . </s> Project Manager : If we wanted something different , truly different , then the buttonless remote control w would be it . </s> Industrial Designer : P Well the only problem I can think of with that is if you've got a lot of people that don't wanna be bothered learning how to use new rem remote controls .

That one . </s> Marketing : That one . Cool . Well these are functionality requirements from the {disfmarker} our our guys down in the the research lab . Took hundred people and covered all the aspects of what um is needed by people and what they want to see . Um {vocalsound} everything kinda from functionality and how individual functions are {disfmarker} how mu how how often they're used and how much their necessary and stuff . And general opinions about current current remotes . See that , as we kinda noticed , seventy five percent of people find their remote controls ugly . So some kind of a new style should be incorporated that's less ugly {vocalsound} . Uh along with um looking less ugly , if it looks better , eighty percent of people said they'd spend more money on it . Which is a a plus for us , if we can make it look better , it'd be uh more cost effective and we can put the price up . Current remote controls do not match the operating behaviour of the user . I can empl I kinda take that to mean as um {vocalsound} they they don't uh {disfmarker} they , yeah , they only use {disfmarker} they only work for the television or yeah like as in in my flat I've got six remote controls for a stereo system , a digital box , a D_V_D_ player , a video player and T_V_ . If it was uh {disfmarker} I mean th my behaviour is to use multiple things at the same time and multiple remotes aren't really matched well to my behaviour . {vocalsound} Uh again , seventy five percent is {disfmarker} seventy five percent of users say they zap a lot . I took to mean that they just {disfmarker} they use it a lot , they use it regularly rather than standing up and manually change channels or volume {gap} . {vocalsound} And uh yeah , uh I think the big issue is fifty percent users only use ten percent of the buttons , 'cause uh wh if we got a remote that like {disfmarker} well we'll have some buttons taken off by the lack of teletext , but uh oh and we're going to see uh on the {disfmarker} uh that some of the functions like audio settings aren't h hardly ever used and used very {disfmarker} aren't considered relevant by the user . So I think maybe fewer buttons , which also make the design look sleeker , I dunno . Uh um yeah and uh frustrations of like people losing remote control . </s> Project Manager : Mm . </s> Marketing : I dunno maybe some kind of system of you press a button on the T_V_ or maybe that's b it would have to incorporate {gap} , but like some kind of system where you can f use something else to find the remote control . Maybe like it'll beep or something . And um , yep , the uh time taken to learn new remote controls is {disfmarker} Uh don't want to make it too complicated , easy to use for uh new {disfmarker} like first time users and stuff . And uh repetitive strain injury , I suppose we should make it more comfortable and make ma possibly even use {disfmarker} have to make it , yeah , fewer buttons , like I was saying about the whole mice {disfmarker} the mouse idea of it feels more comfortable . </s> Project Manager : Mm . </s> Marketing : Maybe don't even have to hold it as such . </s> Project Manager : Gosh , must be some telly addicts out there if they get R_S_I_ from their television remote , is all I can say . </s> Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} </s> User Interface : {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : But uh yeah . It also asked um if we would {disfmarker} if people would pay more for speech recognition </s> Project Manager : {vocalsound} {gap} </s> Marketing : and younger people say they would . And uh there was another section on our {disfmarker} on the report for uh L_C_D_ displays , but the data wasn't there , so . I don't actually know what the results for that were , </s> Project Manager : Mm . Right . Mm . </s> Marketing : so . {vocalsound} May be incrementally emitting , but yeah . </s> Project Manager : Yeah , I must say that um the uh {disfmarker} I c can't remember what {vocalsound} um f you know phone service I was using the other day , but that had sorta speech recognition which worked uh remarkably well , so that is indeed a uh um a thought </s> Marketing : And uh {vocalsound} it would cut out the R_S_I_ as well if you {disfmarker} {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : and it it cuts out uh {disfmarker} I was was gonna say , you can't get a lot of R_S_I_ , </s> Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : j just get jaw ache . Okay , sorry . {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : Yeah , um {disfmarker} oh yeah , so possibly the speech recognition is possibly something could add into the design . Oh , I've got some other things I couldn't fit onto this presentation . Um . You see this okay ? Almost {disfmarker} no ? It's {disfmarker} sorry it's a bit {gap} . I'll read out to you . Uh functionality , uh like people's opinions on functionality , the relevance to the remote and how often they're used . So um like the power . Using the using the d swi the power switch to switch on T_V_ is a high relevance of nine , but it's not frequently used . You see what I mean ? </s> Project Manager : Yeah . {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : Whereas channel selection , which is very high relevance </s> Project Manager : Mm-hmm . </s> Marketing : is used the most . So m we can maybe even start to cut down on {disfmarker} or I was possibly even thinking of a design that maybe some of the buttons are hidden from everyday use . Maybe like uh a folding ledge or something . So that we can maybe go into the channel settings and the audio settings , </s> Industrial Designer : Mm . </s> Marketing : which are low relevance </s> Project Manager : {vocalsound} Mm-hmm . I mean {disfmarker} </s> Marketing : and rarely used . And keep the v volume selection and channel selection very easily {disfmarker} </s> User Interface : It could be {disfmarker} oh uh I was just gonna say uh maybe like the flip phones that they use ? </s> Industrial Designer : Mm . </s> User Interface : Have you seen the new mo mobile phones </s> Project Manager : {vocalsound} Yeah . </s> User Interface : that flip out and they have the like texting , and then the numbers on one side , </s> Marketing : Oh yeah . </s> User Interface : so </s> Project Manager : Mm . </s> User Interface : you could have the most {vocalsound} used buttons on top and flip it out or something . </s> Project Manager : Hmm , hmm . </s> Industrial Designer : Mm . </s> Marketing : Yeah , like the one that like slides back </s> Project Manager : Uh . Should we actually bite the bullet here ? </s> Marketing : and the buttons are concealed underneath . </s> User Interface : Yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : Mm . </s> Project Manager : If people really don't use those buttons to any extent at all um {vocalsound} remove them altogether . </s> Marketing : Just remove them completely ? </s> Project Manager : We we could actually have we could actually have a remote control with um {disfmarker} </s> User Interface : That might be the {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : I wonder whether we could get the remote control with no buttons at all if we went for voice recognition , given that um the {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Um now the the age structure we were looking at {disfmarker} um I mean w we had usage by age structure , what we didn't have was what proportion of people using remotes were in those particular age groups . Now do we know whether they {disfmarker} </s> Marketing : Uh yeah . </s> Project Manager : Forty {disfmarker} no sorry {disfmarker} for forty five to fifty five age group , uh to put myself right in the middle of it , um u use remote controls to a great extent . </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} </s> Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : Yes we {disfmarker} </s> Marketing : Um no this is for {disfmarker} pay more for speech recognition . </s> Project Manager : That would 've speech recogn right . So , we're looking at {disfmarker} um well again , we don't know the relative proportion {disfmarker} the relative numbers in the age groups . </s> Marketing : Yeah , that's true . </s> Project Manager : If we wanted something different , truly different , then the buttonless remote control w would be it . </s> Industrial Designer : P Well the only problem I can think of with that is if you've got a lot of people that don't wanna be bothered learning how to use new rem remote controls . If you just kind of take away everything that they're used to knowing , that's gonna be quite a change . </s> Project Manager : But if you just lift it up and say , channel one or B_B_C_ {disfmarker} </s> Industrial Designer : It might {disfmarker} </s> Marketing : Or even {disfmarker} I mean you could even just have it left on . </s> User Interface : Maybe i </s> Marketing : You could just put it down once on top your T_V_ and never have to {disfmarker} </s> User Interface : Yeah , have a big kind of like the satellite box or the cable box </s> Project Manager : {vocalsound} </s> User Interface : and have it just go on the T_V_ and then it doesn't matter where in the room you are , </s> Industrial Designer : Mm . </s> User Interface : you won't lose it . </s> Marketing : Yeah . </s> Project Manager : It c well it {disfmarker} I can I can see technical problems with that in terms of the , you know , the sound from the television , </s> Industrial Designer : Mm . </s> User Interface : No . </s> Project Manager : because if somebody actually on the television says uh uh , you know , I_T_V_ and you're watching B_B_C_ then then it might um change itself , </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} B_B_C_ one . {vocalsound} </s> Industrial Designer : Yeah . {vocalsound} </s> User Interface : {vocalsound} Oh . {vocalsound} </s> Industrial Designer : Yeah . </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : so it probably needs to be um {disfmarker} possibly actually need a button on it </s> User Interface : Yeah , that's true . </s> Project Manager : just to activate it . </s> Marketing : Oh yeah . </s> Project Manager : Or or something just to identify that you've lifted it up and it's use . And and then just say , oh I don't know , a thought and and then {disfmarker} </s> User Interface : Yeah . </s> Project Manager : uh I mean that that would certainly be uh truly different . {vocalsound} Um 'cause uh you know audio settings , nought point eight percent . I mean if they weren't there , {vocalsound} would people miss them ? </s> Marketing : Mm-mm . </s> Industrial Designer : But look at the importance of them . The volume settings . </s> Project Manager : {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : Relevance of two out of ten , </s> Project Manager : Vol volume , </s> Marketing : yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : Yeah . </s> Project Manager : yes um </s> Industrial Designer : They're not used often </s> Project Manager : th {vocalsound} </s> Industrial Designer : but they are quite important when they're used . </s> Project Manager : w we need to s identify things that {vocalsound} people actually need </s> Industrial Designer : Yeah . </s> Project Manager : and and it's a function of frequency and relevance . And um I would say ignoring ig ignoring power for the moment , um the channel and volume </s> Industrial Designer : Mm . </s> Project Manager : and th w w given given that we've been told to ignore teletext . Uh channel and volume are the only ones that </s> Marketing : Yeah . </s> Project Manager : {vocalsound} uh would appear to be essential . </s> Marketing : Stand out . </s> Project Manager : Um . So {disfmarker} if we can design something that that looks interesting , know , or looks different , um incorporates the the logo and and the colours and um we can still have our interchangeable fascias even if it's {gap} the yellow and grey , um and uh I dunno , buttons or or buttons as an option . </s> Marketing : Uh I just had a thought actually , sorry to interrupt . </s> Project Manager : Do , please . </s> Marketing : Uh you were saying about um it could {disfmarker} technical problems of like uh someone on the television saying a channel number and it changed {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : Mm-hmm . </s> Marketing : we could maybe have like an activation word . </s> Project Manager : You cer certainly could . </s> Marketing : 'Cause I've seen I've seen this used on computers before , where you just {disfmarker} you address the remote , </s> Project Manager : {vocalsound} Depe uh i depends whether um {disfmarker} </s> Industrial Designer : Mm . </s> Marketing : you address the computer , and then give it a command . </s> Project Manager : if we want to make this so simple that anybody can walk into the room and lift it up and say </s> Marketing : Oh I see . Oh yeah , I see . </s> Project Manager : B_B_C_ one . Um okay , I mean you could print {disfmarker} actually print it on the uh </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} Mm-hmm , yeah . </s> Project Manager : device itself . Um . </s> Marketing : I mean I'm just thinking of the point of view of peop you could still like lose this remote . </s> Project Manager : S th this I th {vocalsound} that's always gonna be a problem I think . </s> Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : Mm . </s> Project Manager : Um and I I I s so I suppose one um {disfmarker} could make it so desirable that if people lose it they immediately go out and buy another one . </s> Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} </s> User Interface : {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : Anyway , sorry , carry on . Do you want to just carry on with {disfmarker} </s> Marketing : Oh no </s> Project Manager : or {disfmarker} </s> Marketing : I I interrupted you , </s> Project Manager : no no , no uh b I was in the middle of in the middle of your report there . {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : sorry {vocalsound} . Oh okay . Um well , I was just kinda wrapping up there . Yeah , </s> Project Manager : Mm okay . {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : I was thinking um , yeah , maybe such things are relevant . We could make things much more f I think the the eighty percent of people would spend more on uh a remote uh that looks better , combined with uh decrease the {disfmarker} or take out the limited functio functions that we don't really use much . {gap} alright take out teletext , but as for channel settings and stuff it might it might um turn people somewhe peop some people that want the whole functionality away . But , since {disfmarker} if we're marketing a more kind of fashionable approach then it'd {disfmarker} it would be fashion and fashion over practicality . </s> Project Manager : Mm-hmm . S s we could {disfmarker} we could make it dual function {gap} voice recognition and {gap} still have buttons on it um </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} Oh , we could , yeah . We c yeah , </s> Project Manager : 'cause we're {disfmarker} </s> Marketing : we could even have it as like a {disfmarker} yeah the buttons control this and the voice functions control the f things that you would do all the time , so . </s> Project Manager : {vocalsound} Certainly could . Yeah , yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : Mm . </s> Marketing : So uh yeah , if we could uh {disfmarker} power on and channel selection and and volume selection , wouldn't have to really {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : {gap} The {disfmarker} I mean the the advantage of doing away the buttons altogether is it makes the thing cheaper . </s> Marketing : Yeah and probably it would look better as well . </s> Project Manager : No , it cou certainly opens up the possibility for making it uh , you know , visually very distinctive . </s> Marketing : Yeah . yeah . </s> Project Manager : Um 'cause you know , it does not have to be a oblong box . </s> Industrial Designer : Mm . </s> Marketing : Lined with numbered buttons and {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : Mm , yeah . Okay , who {disfmarker} sorry , have you have you finished there Andy ? </s> Marketing : Uh yeah , yeah , that's everything . </s> Project Manager : Yep , yep . Um {vocalsound} given that we've already had a extensive discussion uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} . </s> Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} </s> User Interface : {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} </s> User Interface : Okay well , I can do mine . </s> Industrial Designer : Hmm . </s> Marketing : Do you want the cable ? </s> User Interface : Yeah , let's see if I can make this work . Um . </s> Industrial Designer : Oh , you have to hit like function and F_ something . </s> User Interface : Oh . </s> Marketing : F_ eight . </s> Industrial Designer : F_ eight . </s> User Interface : Is it doing {disfmarker} </s> Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Dunno . </s> Marketing : Uh , give it about twenty seconds , or so . </s> User Interface : Okay . </s> Project Manager : Ah , there we go . {vocalsound} </s> Industrial Designer : Oh yeah , it's going . </s> User Interface : Oh okay . {vocalsound} Okay , so this is just about the technical functions . </s> Project Manager : Alright . </s> User Interface : So the method , I looked online for examples of other similar products and then just kind of was trying to brainstorm some possible design ideas and um identify what the necessary things are , what people are {disfmarker} what you really wanna have a remote control do . Um and then there are two different kinds that I found . There's a user centred one and an engineering centred one which I will have pictures of and then we kinda have to decide which one this should be . </s> Project Manager : Mm-hmm . </s> User Interface : {vocalsound} So these are the two different ones . This one um {disfmarker} this is the user centred , it has uh quite a few mm uh um fewer buttons </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} </s> User Interface : and then this is the engineering centred , which has a lot more buttons , </s> Project Manager : Mm-hmm . </s> User Interface : and probably this is one that people complain about , about having too many buttons that you don't use . So basically , what a remote control is is you {disfmarker} it's to send messages to the television set , you know , turn on , off , switch the channels and the volume and things such as that . And so for this product it's gonna be television only , and then it has to have the uh logos for the company and the colours . And so , for my personal preferences , I think this one is easier to use and has quite a {disfmarker} you know , fewer buttons . Um we want something that sends messages easily to the television and I was kind of wondering about this example that they have . It looks kind of narrow at the top , and I was thinking maybe if it were wider at the top , </s> Project Manager : Mm , yeah . </s> User Interface : then that would be easier . Um {vocalsound} and so we have to decide what's gonna make our product different . E the unique style , maybe have it light up so it's visible in the dark , um the changeable face-plates , and the lighting up and visible I was {disfmarker} when we were talking about havi losing it , maybe to have a button on the television that you press and it {disfmarker} maybe if it makes a noise or lights up or something like that , so it's easier to find if someone has hidden under the couch or something like that . So that's my presentation . Yeah .",

I mean if they weren't there , {vocalsound} would people miss them ? </s> Marketing : Mm-mm . </s> Industrial Designer : But look at the importance of them . The volume settings . </s> Project Manager : {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : Relevance of two out of ten , </s> Project Manager : Vol volume , </s> Marketing : yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : Yeah . </s> Project Manager : yes um </s> Industrial Designer : They're not used often </s> Project Manager : th {vocalsound} </s> Industrial Designer : but they are quite important when they're used . </s> Project Manager : w we need to s identify things that {vocalsound} people actually need </s> Industrial Designer : Yeah . </s> Project Manager : and and it's a function of frequency and relevance .

Uh channel and volume are the only ones that </s> Marketing : Yeah . </s> Project Manager : {vocalsound} uh would appear to be essential . </s> Marketing : Stand out . </s> Project Manager : Um .

Oh okay . Um well , I was just kinda wrapping up there . Yeah , </s> Project Manager : Mm okay . {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : I was thinking um , yeah , maybe such things are relevant . We could make things much more f I think the the eighty percent of people would spend more on uh a remote uh that looks better , combined with uh decrease the {disfmarker} or take out the limited functio functions that we don't really use much . {gap} alright take out teletext , but as for channel settings and stuff it might it might um turn people somewhe peop some people that want the whole functionality away . But , since {disfmarker} if we're marketing a more kind of fashionable approach then it'd {disfmarker} it would be fashion and fashion over practicality . </s> Project Manager : Mm-hmm . S s we could {disfmarker} we could make it dual function {gap} voice recognition and {gap} still have buttons on it um </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} Oh , we could , yeah . We c yeah , </s> Project Manager : 'cause we're {disfmarker} </s> Marketing : we could even have it as like a {disfmarker} yeah the buttons control this and the voice functions control the f things that you would do all the time , so . </s> Project Manager : {vocalsound} Certainly could . Yeah , yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : Mm . </s> Marketing : So uh yeah , if we could uh {disfmarker} power on and channel selection and and volume selection , wouldn't have to really {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : {gap} The {disfmarker} I mean the the advantage of doing away the buttons altogether is it makes the thing cheaper . </s> Marketing : Yeah and probably it would look better as well . </s> Project Manager : No , it cou certainly opens up the possibility for making it uh , you know , visually very distinctive . </s> Marketing : Yeah . yeah . </s> Project Manager : Um 'cause you know , it does not have to be a oblong box . </s> Industrial Designer : Mm . </s> Marketing : Lined with numbered buttons and {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : Mm , yeah . Okay , who {disfmarker} sorry , have you have you finished there Andy ? </s> Marketing : Uh yeah , yeah , that's everything . </s> Project Manager : Yep , yep . Um {vocalsound} given that we've already had a extensive discussion uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} . </s> Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} </s> User Interface : {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} </s> User Interface : Okay well , I can do mine . </s> Industrial Designer : Hmm . </s> Marketing : Do you want the cable ? </s> User Interface : Yeah , let's see if I can make this work . Um . </s> Industrial Designer : Oh , you have to hit like function and F_ something . </s> User Interface : Oh . </s> Marketing : F_ eight . </s> Industrial Designer : F_ eight . </s> User Interface : Is it doing {disfmarker} </s> Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Dunno . </s> Marketing : Uh , give it about twenty seconds , or so . </s> User Interface : Okay . </s> Project Manager : Ah , there we go . {vocalsound} </s> Industrial Designer : Oh yeah , it's going . </s> User Interface : Oh okay . {vocalsound} Okay , so this is just about the technical functions . </s> Project Manager : Alright . </s> User Interface : So the method , I looked online for examples of other similar products and then just kind of was trying to brainstorm some possible design ideas and um identify what the necessary things are , what people are {disfmarker} what you really wanna have a remote control do . Um and then there are two different kinds that I found . There's a user centred one and an engineering centred one which I will have pictures of and then we kinda have to decide which one this should be . </s> Project Manager : Mm-hmm . </s> User Interface : {vocalsound} So these are the two different ones . This one um {disfmarker} this is the user centred , it has uh quite a few mm uh um fewer buttons </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} </s> User Interface : and then this is the engineering centred , which has a lot more buttons , </s> Project Manager : Mm-hmm . </s> User Interface : and probably this is one that people complain about , about having too many buttons that you don't use . So basically , what a remote control is is you {disfmarker} it's to send messages to the television set , you know , turn on , off , switch the channels and the volume and things such as that . And so for this product it's gonna be television only , and then it has to have the uh logos for the company and the colours . And so , for my personal preferences , I think this one is easier to use and has quite a {disfmarker} you know , fewer buttons . Um we want something that sends messages easily to the television and I was kind of wondering about this example that they have . It looks kind of narrow at the top , and I was thinking maybe if it were wider at the top , </s> Project Manager : Mm , yeah . </s> User Interface : then that would be easier . Um {vocalsound} and so we have to decide what's gonna make our product different . E the unique style , maybe have it light up so it's visible in the dark , um the changeable face-plates , and the lighting up and visible I was {disfmarker} when we were talking about havi losing it , maybe to have a button on the television that you press and it {disfmarker} maybe if it makes a noise or lights up or something like that , so it's easier to find if someone has hidden under the couch or something like that .

That one . </s> Marketing : That one . Cool . Well these are functionality requirements from the {disfmarker} our our guys down in the the research lab . Took hundred people and covered all the aspects of what um is needed by people and what they want to see . Um {vocalsound} everything kinda from functionality and how individual functions are {disfmarker} how mu how how often they're used and how much their necessary and stuff . And general opinions about current current remotes . See that , as we kinda noticed , seventy five percent of people find their remote controls ugly . So some kind of a new style should be incorporated that's less ugly {vocalsound} . Uh along with um looking less ugly , if it looks better , eighty percent of people said they'd spend more money on it . Which is a a plus for us , if we can make it look better , it'd be uh more cost effective and we can put the price up . Current remote controls do not match the operating behaviour of the user . I can empl I kinda take that to mean as um {vocalsound} they they don't uh {disfmarker} they , yeah , they only use {disfmarker} they only work for the television or yeah like as in in my flat I've got six remote controls for a stereo system , a digital box , a D_V_D_ player , a video player and T_V_ . If it was uh {disfmarker} I mean th my behaviour is to use multiple things at the same time and multiple remotes aren't really matched well to my behaviour . {vocalsound} Uh again , seventy five percent is {disfmarker} seventy five percent of users say they zap a lot . I took to mean that they just {disfmarker} they use it a lot , they use it regularly rather than standing up and manually change channels or volume {gap} . {vocalsound} And uh yeah , uh I think the big issue is fifty percent users only use ten percent of the buttons , 'cause uh wh if we got a remote that like {disfmarker} well we'll have some buttons taken off by the lack of teletext , but uh oh and we're going to see uh on the {disfmarker} uh that some of the functions like audio settings aren't h hardly ever used and used very {disfmarker} aren't considered relevant by the user . So I think maybe fewer buttons , which also make the design look sleeker , I dunno . Uh um yeah and uh frustrations of like people losing remote control . </s> Project Manager : Mm . </s> Marketing : I dunno maybe some kind of system of you press a button on the T_V_ or maybe that's b it would have to incorporate {gap} , but like some kind of system where you can f use something else to find the remote control . Maybe like it'll beep or something . And um , yep , the uh time taken to learn new remote controls is {disfmarker} Uh don't want to make it too complicated , easy to use for uh new {disfmarker} like first time users and stuff . And uh repetitive strain injury , I suppose we should make it more comfortable and make ma possibly even use {disfmarker} have to make it , yeah , fewer buttons , like I was saying about the whole mice {disfmarker} the mouse idea of it feels more comfortable . </s> Project Manager : Mm . </s> Marketing : Maybe don't even have to hold it as such . </s> Project Manager : Gosh , must be some telly addicts out there if they get R_S_I_ from their television remote , is all I can say . </s> Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} </s> User Interface : {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : But uh yeah . It also asked um if we would {disfmarker} if people would pay more for speech recognition </s> Project Manager : {vocalsound} {gap} </s> Marketing : and younger people say they would . And uh there was another section on our {disfmarker} on the report for uh L_C_D_ displays , but the data wasn't there , so . I don't actually know what the results for that were , </s> Project Manager : Mm . Right . Mm . </s> Marketing : so . {vocalsound} May be incrementally emitting , but yeah . </s> Project Manager : Yeah , I must say that um the uh {disfmarker} I c can't remember what {vocalsound} um f you know phone service I was using the other day , but that had sorta speech recognition which worked uh remarkably well , so that is indeed a uh um a thought </s> Marketing : And uh {vocalsound} it would cut out the R_S_I_ as well if you {disfmarker} {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : and it it cuts out uh {disfmarker} I was was gonna say , you can't get a lot of R_S_I_ , </s> Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : j just get jaw ache . Okay , sorry . {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : Yeah , um {disfmarker} oh yeah , so possibly the speech recognition is possibly something could add into the design . Oh , I've got some other things I couldn't fit onto this presentation . Um . You see this okay ? Almost {disfmarker} no ? It's {disfmarker} sorry it's a bit {gap} . I'll read out to you . Uh functionality , uh like people's opinions on functionality , the relevance to the remote and how often they're used . So um like the power . Using the using the d swi the power switch to switch on T_V_ is a high relevance of nine , but it's not frequently used . You see what I mean ? </s> Project Manager : Yeah . {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : Whereas channel selection , which is very high relevance </s> Project Manager : Mm-hmm . </s> Marketing : is used the most . So m we can maybe even start to cut down on {disfmarker} or I was possibly even thinking of a design that maybe some of the buttons are hidden from everyday use . Maybe like uh a folding ledge or something . So that we can maybe go into the channel settings and the audio settings , </s> Industrial Designer : Mm . </s> Marketing : which are low relevance </s> Project Manager : {vocalsound} Mm-hmm . I mean {disfmarker} </s> Marketing : and rarely used . And keep the v volume selection and channel selection very easily {disfmarker} </s> User Interface : It could be {disfmarker} oh uh I was just gonna say uh maybe like the flip phones that they use ? </s> Industrial Designer : Mm . </s> User Interface : Have you seen the new mo mobile phones </s> Project Manager : {vocalsound} Yeah . </s> User Interface : that flip out and they have the like texting , and then the numbers on one side , </s> Marketing : Oh yeah . </s> User Interface : so </s> Project Manager : Mm . </s> User Interface : you could have the most {vocalsound} used buttons on top and flip it out or something . </s> Project Manager : Hmm , hmm . </s> Industrial Designer : Mm . </s> Marketing : Yeah , like the one that like slides back </s> Project Manager : Uh . Should we actually bite the bullet here ? </s> Marketing : and the buttons are concealed underneath . </s> User Interface : Yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : Mm . </s> Project Manager : If people really don't use those buttons to any extent at all um {vocalsound} remove them altogether . </s> Marketing : Just remove them completely ? </s> Project Manager : We we could actually have we could actually have a remote control with um {disfmarker} </s> User Interface : That might be the {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : I wonder whether we could get the remote control with no buttons at all if we went for voice recognition , given that um the {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Um now the the age structure we were looking at {disfmarker} um I mean w we had usage by age structure , what we didn't have was what proportion of people using remotes were in those particular age groups . Now do we know whether they {disfmarker} </s> Marketing : Uh yeah . </s> Project Manager : Forty {disfmarker} no sorry {disfmarker} for forty five to fifty five age group , uh to put myself right in the middle of it , um u use remote controls to a great extent . </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} </s> Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : Yes we {disfmarker} </s> Marketing : Um no this is for {disfmarker} pay more for speech recognition . </s> Project Manager : That would 've speech recogn right . So , we're looking at {disfmarker} um well again , we don't know the relative proportion {disfmarker} the relative numbers in the age groups . </s> Marketing : Yeah , that's true . </s> Project Manager : If we wanted something different , truly different , then the buttonless remote control w would be it . </s> Industrial Designer : P Well the only problem I can think of with that is if you've got a lot of people that don't wanna be bothered learning how to use new rem remote controls . If you just kind of take away everything that they're used to knowing , that's gonna be quite a change . </s> Project Manager : But if you just lift it up and say , channel one or B_B_C_ {disfmarker} </s> Industrial Designer : It might {disfmarker} </s> Marketing : Or even {disfmarker} I mean you could even just have it left on . </s> User Interface : Maybe i </s> Marketing : You could just put it down once on top your T_V_ and never have to {disfmarker} </s> User Interface : Yeah , have a big kind of like the satellite box or the cable box </s> Project Manager : {vocalsound} </s> User Interface : and have it just go on the T_V_ and then it doesn't matter where in the room you are , </s> Industrial Designer : Mm . </s> User Interface : you won't lose it . </s> Marketing : Yeah . </s> Project Manager : It c well it {disfmarker} I can I can see technical problems with that in terms of the , you know , the sound from the television , </s> Industrial Designer : Mm . </s> User Interface : No . </s> Project Manager : because if somebody actually on the television says uh uh , you know , I_T_V_ and you're watching B_B_C_ then then it might um change itself , </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} B_B_C_ one . {vocalsound} </s> Industrial Designer : Yeah . {vocalsound} </s> User Interface : {vocalsound} Oh . {vocalsound} </s> Industrial Designer : Yeah . </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : so it probably needs to be um {disfmarker} possibly actually need a button on it </s> User Interface : Yeah , that's true . </s> Project Manager : just to activate it . </s> Marketing : Oh yeah . </s> Project Manager : Or or something just to identify that you've lifted it up and it's use .

That one . </s> Marketing : That one . Cool . Well these are functionality requirements from the {disfmarker} our our guys down in the the research lab . Took hundred people and covered all the aspects of what um is needed by people and what they want to see . Um {vocalsound} everything kinda from functionality and how individual functions are {disfmarker} how mu how how often they're used and how much their necessary and stuff . And general opinions about current current remotes . See that , as we kinda noticed , seventy five percent of people find their remote controls ugly . So some kind of a new style should be incorporated that's less ugly {vocalsound} . Uh along with um looking less ugly , if it looks better , eighty percent of people said they'd spend more money on it . Which is a a plus for us , if we can make it look better , it'd be uh more cost effective and we can put the price up . Current remote controls do not match the operating behaviour of the user . I can empl I kinda take that to mean as um {vocalsound} they they don't uh {disfmarker} they , yeah , they only use {disfmarker} they only work for the television or yeah like as in in my flat I've got six remote controls for a stereo system , a digital box , a D_V_D_ player , a video player and T_V_ . If it was uh {disfmarker} I mean th my behaviour is to use multiple things at the same time and multiple remotes aren't really matched well to my behaviour . {vocalsound} Uh again , seventy five percent is {disfmarker} seventy five percent of users say they zap a lot . I took to mean that they just {disfmarker} they use it a lot , they use it regularly rather than standing up and manually change channels or volume {gap} . {vocalsound} And uh yeah , uh I think the big issue is fifty percent users only use ten percent of the buttons , 'cause uh wh if we got a remote that like {disfmarker} well we'll have some buttons taken off by the lack of teletext , but uh oh and we're going to see uh on the {disfmarker} uh that some of the functions like audio settings aren't h hardly ever used and used very {disfmarker} aren't considered relevant by the user . So I think maybe fewer buttons , which also make the design look sleeker , I dunno . Uh um yeah and uh frustrations of like people losing remote control . </s> Project Manager : Mm . </s> Marketing : I dunno maybe some kind of system of you press a button on the T_V_ or maybe that's b it would have to incorporate {gap} , but like some kind of system where you can f use something else to find the remote control . Maybe like it'll beep or something . And um , yep , the uh time taken to learn new remote controls is {disfmarker} Uh don't want to make it too complicated , easy to use for uh new {disfmarker} like first time users and stuff . And uh repetitive strain injury , I suppose we should make it more comfortable and make ma possibly even use {disfmarker} have to make it , yeah , fewer buttons , like I was saying about the whole mice {disfmarker} the mouse idea of it feels more comfortable . </s> Project Manager : Mm . </s> Marketing : Maybe don't even have to hold it as such . </s> Project Manager : Gosh , must be some telly addicts out there if they get R_S_I_ from their television remote , is all I can say . </s> Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} </s> User Interface : {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : But uh yeah . It also asked um if we would {disfmarker} if people would pay more for speech recognition </s> Project Manager : {vocalsound} {gap} </s> Marketing : and younger people say they would . And uh there was another section on our {disfmarker} on the report for uh L_C_D_ displays , but the data wasn't there , so . I don't actually know what the results for that were , </s> Project Manager : Mm . Right . Mm . </s> Marketing : so . {vocalsound} May be incrementally emitting , but yeah . </s> Project Manager : Yeah , I must say that um the uh {disfmarker} I c can't remember what {vocalsound} um f you know phone service I was using the other day , but that had sorta speech recognition which worked uh remarkably well , so that is indeed a uh um a thought </s> Marketing : And uh {vocalsound} it would cut out the R_S_I_ as well if you {disfmarker} {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : and it it cuts out uh {disfmarker} I was was gonna say , you can't get a lot of R_S_I_ , </s> Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : j just get jaw ache . Okay , sorry . {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : Yeah , um {disfmarker} oh yeah , so possibly the speech recognition is possibly something could add into the design . Oh , I've got some other things I couldn't fit onto this presentation . Um . You see this okay ? Almost {disfmarker} no ? It's {disfmarker} sorry it's a bit {gap} . I'll read out to you . Uh functionality , uh like people's opinions on functionality , the relevance to the remote and how often they're used . So um like the power . Using the using the d swi the power switch to switch on T_V_ is a high relevance of nine , but it's not frequently used . You see what I mean ? </s> Project Manager : Yeah . {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : Whereas channel selection , which is very high relevance </s> Project Manager : Mm-hmm . </s> Marketing : is used the most . So m we can maybe even start to cut down on {disfmarker} or I was possibly even thinking of a design that maybe some of the buttons are hidden from everyday use . Maybe like uh a folding ledge or something . So that we can maybe go into the channel settings and the audio settings , </s> Industrial Designer : Mm . </s> Marketing : which are low relevance </s> Project Manager : {vocalsound} Mm-hmm . I mean {disfmarker} </s> Marketing : and rarely used . And keep the v volume selection and channel selection very easily {disfmarker} </s> User Interface : It could be {disfmarker} oh uh I was just gonna say uh maybe like the flip phones that they use ? </s> Industrial Designer : Mm . </s> User Interface : Have you seen the new mo mobile phones </s> Project Manager : {vocalsound} Yeah . </s> User Interface : that flip out and they have the like texting , and then the numbers on one side , </s> Marketing : Oh yeah . </s> User Interface : so </s> Project Manager : Mm . </s> User Interface : you could have the most {vocalsound} used buttons on top and flip it out or something . </s> Project Manager : Hmm , hmm . </s> Industrial Designer : Mm . </s> Marketing : Yeah , like the one that like slides back </s> Project Manager : Uh . Should we actually bite the bullet here ? </s> Marketing : and the buttons are concealed underneath . </s> User Interface : Yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : Mm . </s> Project Manager : If people really don't use those buttons to any extent at all um {vocalsound} remove them altogether . </s> Marketing : Just remove them completely ? </s> Project Manager : We we could actually have we could actually have a remote control with um {disfmarker} </s> User Interface : That might be the {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : I wonder whether we could get the remote control with no buttons at all if we went for voice recognition , given that um the {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Um now the the age structure we were looking at {disfmarker} um I mean w we had usage by age structure , what we didn't have was what proportion of people using remotes were in those particular age groups . Now do we know whether they {disfmarker} </s> Marketing : Uh yeah . </s> Project Manager : Forty {disfmarker} no sorry {disfmarker} for forty five to fifty five age group , uh to put myself right in the middle of it , um u use remote controls to a great extent . </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} </s> Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : Yes we {disfmarker} </s> Marketing : Um no this is for {disfmarker} pay more for speech recognition . </s> Project Manager : That would 've speech recogn right . So , we're looking at {disfmarker} um well again , we don't know the relative proportion {disfmarker} the relative numbers in the age groups . </s> Marketing : Yeah , that's true . </s> Project Manager : If we wanted something different , truly different , then the buttonless remote control w would be it . </s> Industrial Designer : P Well the only problem I can think of with that is if you've got a lot of people that don't wanna be bothered learning how to use new rem remote controls . If you just kind of take away everything that they're used to knowing , that's gonna be quite a change . </s> Project Manager : But if you just lift it up and say , channel one or B_B_C_ {disfmarker} </s> Industrial Designer : It might {disfmarker} </s> Marketing : Or even {disfmarker} I mean you could even just have it left on . </s> User Interface : Maybe i </s> Marketing : You could just put it down once on top your T_V_ and never have to {disfmarker} </s> User Interface : Yeah , have a big kind of like the satellite box or the cable box </s> Project Manager : {vocalsound} </s> User Interface : and have it just go on the T_V_ and then it doesn't matter where in the room you are , </s> Industrial Designer : Mm . </s> User Interface : you won't lose it . </s> Marketing : Yeah . </s> Project Manager : It c well it {disfmarker} I can I can see technical problems with that in terms of the , you know , the sound from the television , </s> Industrial Designer : Mm . </s> User Interface : No . </s> Project Manager : because if somebody actually on the television says uh uh , you know , I_T_V_ and you're watching B_B_C_ then then it might um change itself , </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} B_B_C_ one . {vocalsound} </s> Industrial Designer : Yeah . {vocalsound} </s> User Interface : {vocalsound} Oh . {vocalsound} </s> Industrial Designer : Yeah . </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : so it probably needs to be um {disfmarker} possibly actually need a button on it </s> User Interface : Yeah , that's true . </s> Project Manager : just to activate it . </s> Marketing : Oh yeah . </s> Project Manager : Or or something just to identify that you've lifted it up and it's use . And and then just say , oh I don't know , a thought and and then {disfmarker} </s> User Interface : Yeah . </s> Project Manager : uh I mean that that would certainly be uh truly different . {vocalsound} Um 'cause uh you know audio settings , nought point eight percent . I mean if they weren't there , {vocalsound} would people miss them ? </s> Marketing : Mm-mm . </s> Industrial Designer : But look at the importance of them . The volume settings . </s> Project Manager : {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : Relevance of two out of ten , </s> Project Manager : Vol volume , </s> Marketing : yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : Yeah . </s> Project Manager : yes um </s> Industrial Designer : They're not used often </s> Project Manager : th {vocalsound} </s> Industrial Designer : but they are quite important when they're used . </s> Project Manager : w we need to s identify things that {vocalsound} people actually need </s> Industrial Designer : Yeah . </s> Project Manager : and and it's a function of frequency and relevance . And um I would say ignoring ig ignoring power for the moment , um the channel and volume </s> Industrial Designer : Mm . </s> Project Manager : and th w w given given that we've been told to ignore teletext . Uh channel and volume are the only ones that </s> Marketing : Yeah . </s> Project Manager : {vocalsound} uh would appear to be essential . </s> Marketing : Stand out . </s> Project Manager : Um . So {disfmarker} if we can design something that that looks interesting , know , or looks different , um incorporates the the logo and and the colours and um we can still have our interchangeable fascias even if it's {gap} the yellow and grey , um and uh I dunno , buttons or or buttons as an option . </s> Marketing : Uh I just had a thought actually , sorry to interrupt . </s> Project Manager : Do , please . </s> Marketing : Uh you were saying about um it could {disfmarker} technical problems of like uh someone on the television saying a channel number and it changed {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : Mm-hmm . </s> Marketing : we could maybe have like an activation word . </s> Project Manager : You cer certainly could . </s> Marketing : 'Cause I've seen I've seen this used on computers before , where you just {disfmarker} you address the remote , </s> Project Manager : {vocalsound} Depe uh i depends whether um {disfmarker} </s> Industrial Designer : Mm . </s> Marketing : you address the computer , and then give it a command . </s> Project Manager : if we want to make this so simple that anybody can walk into the room and lift it up and say </s> Marketing : Oh I see . Oh yeah , I see . </s> Project Manager : B_B_C_ one . Um okay , I mean you could print {disfmarker} actually print it on the uh </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} Mm-hmm , yeah . </s> Project Manager : device itself . Um . </s> Marketing : I mean I'm just thinking of the point of view of peop you could still like lose this remote . </s> Project Manager : S th this I th {vocalsound} that's always gonna be a problem I think . </s> Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : Mm . </s> Project Manager : Um and I I I s so I suppose one um {disfmarker} could make it so desirable that if people lose it they immediately go out and buy another one . </s> Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} </s> User Interface : {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : Anyway , sorry , carry on . Do you want to just carry on with {disfmarker} </s> Marketing : Oh no </s> Project Manager : or {disfmarker} </s> Marketing : I I interrupted you , </s> Project Manager : no no , no uh b I was in the middle of in the middle of your report there . {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : sorry {vocalsound} . Oh okay . Um well , I was just kinda wrapping up there . Yeah , </s> Project Manager : Mm okay . {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : I was thinking um , yeah , maybe such things are relevant . We could make things much more f I think the the eighty percent of people would spend more on uh a remote uh that looks better , combined with uh decrease the {disfmarker} or take out the limited functio functions that we don't really use much . {gap} alright take out teletext , but as for channel settings and stuff it might it might um turn people somewhe peop some people that want the whole functionality away . But , since {disfmarker} if we're marketing a more kind of fashionable approach then it'd {disfmarker} it would be fashion and fashion over practicality . </s> Project Manager : Mm-hmm . S s we could {disfmarker} we could make it dual function {gap} voice recognition and {gap} still have buttons on it um </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} Oh , we could , yeah . We c yeah , </s> Project Manager : 'cause we're {disfmarker} </s> Marketing : we could even have it as like a {disfmarker} yeah the buttons control this and the voice functions control the f things that you would do all the time , so . </s> Project Manager : {vocalsound} Certainly could . Yeah , yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : Mm . </s> Marketing : So uh yeah , if we could uh {disfmarker} power on and channel selection and and volume selection , wouldn't have to really {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : {gap} The {disfmarker} I mean the the advantage of doing away the buttons altogether is it makes the thing cheaper . </s> Marketing : Yeah and probably it would look better as well . </s> Project Manager : No , it cou certainly opens up the possibility for making it uh , you know , visually very distinctive . </s> Marketing : Yeah . yeah . </s> Project Manager : Um 'cause you know , it does not have to be a oblong box . </s> Industrial Designer : Mm . </s> Marketing : Lined with numbered buttons and {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : Mm , yeah . Okay , who {disfmarker} sorry , have you have you finished there Andy ? </s> Marketing : Uh yeah , yeah , that's everything . </s> Project Manager : Yep , yep . Um {vocalsound} given that we've already had a extensive discussion uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} . </s> Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} </s> User Interface : {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} </s> User Interface : Okay well , I can do mine . </s> Industrial Designer : Hmm . </s> Marketing : Do you want the cable ? </s> User Interface : Yeah , let's see if I can make this work . Um . </s> Industrial Designer : Oh , you have to hit like function and F_ something . </s> User Interface : Oh . </s> Marketing : F_ eight . </s> Industrial Designer : F_ eight . </s> User Interface : Is it doing {disfmarker} </s> Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Dunno . </s> Marketing : Uh , give it about twenty seconds , or so . </s> User Interface : Okay . </s> Project Manager : Ah , there we go . {vocalsound} </s> Industrial Designer : Oh yeah , it's going . </s> User Interface : Oh okay . {vocalsound} Okay , so this is just about the technical functions . </s> Project Manager : Alright . </s> User Interface : So the method , I looked online for examples of other similar products and then just kind of was trying to brainstorm some possible design ideas and um identify what the necessary things are , what people are {disfmarker} what you really wanna have a remote control do . Um and then there are two different kinds that I found . There's a user centred one and an engineering centred one which I will have pictures of and then we kinda have to decide which one this should be . </s> Project Manager : Mm-hmm . </s> User Interface : {vocalsound} So these are the two different ones . This one um {disfmarker} this is the user centred , it has uh quite a few mm uh um fewer buttons </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} </s> User Interface : and then this is the engineering centred , which has a lot more buttons , </s> Project Manager : Mm-hmm . </s> User Interface : and probably this is one that people complain about , about having too many buttons that you don't use . So basically , what a remote control is is you {disfmarker} it's to send messages to the television set , you know , turn on , off , switch the channels and the volume and things such as that . And so for this product it's gonna be television only , and then it has to have the uh logos for the company and the colours . And so , for my personal preferences , I think this one is easier to use and has quite a {disfmarker} you know , fewer buttons . Um we want something that sends messages easily to the television and I was kind of wondering about this example that they have . It looks kind of narrow at the top , and I was thinking maybe if it were wider at the top , </s> Project Manager : Mm , yeah . </s> User Interface : then that would be easier . Um {vocalsound} and so we have to decide what's gonna make our product different . E the unique style , maybe have it light up so it's visible in the dark , um the changeable face-plates , and the lighting up and visible I was {disfmarker} when we were talking about havi losing it , maybe to have a button on the television that you press and it {disfmarker} maybe if it makes a noise or lights up or something like that , so it's easier to find if someone has hidden under the couch or something like that . So that's my presentation . Yeah .",

So {disfmarker} if we can design something that that looks interesting , know , or looks different , um incorporates the the logo and and the colours and um we can still have our interchangeable fascias even if it's {gap} the yellow and grey , um and uh I dunno , buttons or or buttons as an option . </s> Marketing : Uh I just had a thought actually , sorry to interrupt . </s> Project Manager : Do , please . </s> Marketing : Uh you were saying about um it could {disfmarker} technical problems of like uh someone on the television saying a channel number and it changed {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : Mm-hmm . </s> Marketing : we could maybe have like an activation word . </s> Project Manager : You cer certainly could . </s> Marketing : 'Cause I've seen I've seen this used on computers before , where you just {disfmarker} you address the remote , </s> Project Manager : {vocalsound} Depe uh i depends whether um {disfmarker} </s> Industrial Designer : Mm . </s> Marketing : you address the computer , and then give it a command . </s> Project Manager : if we want to make this so simple that anybody can walk into the room and lift it up and say </s> Marketing : Oh I see . Oh yeah , I see . </s> Project Manager : B_B_C_ one . Um okay , I mean you could print {disfmarker} actually print it on the uh </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} Mm-hmm , yeah . </s> Project Manager : device itself . Um . </s> Marketing : I mean I'm just thinking of the point of view of peop you could still like lose this remote . </s> Project Manager : S th this I th {vocalsound} that's always gonna be a problem I think . </s> Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : Mm . </s> Project Manager : Um and I I I s so I suppose one um {disfmarker} could make it so desirable that if people lose it they immediately go out and buy another one . </s> Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} </s> User Interface : {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : Anyway , sorry , carry on . Do you want to just carry on with {disfmarker} </s> Marketing : Oh no </s> Project Manager : or {disfmarker} </s> Marketing : I I interrupted you , </s> Project Manager : no no , no uh b I was in the middle of in the middle of your report there . {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : sorry {vocalsound} . Oh okay . Um well , I was just kinda wrapping up there . Yeah , </s> Project Manager : Mm okay . {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : I was thinking um , yeah , maybe such things are relevant . We could make things much more f I think the the eighty percent of people would spend more on uh a remote uh that looks better , combined with uh decrease the {disfmarker} or take out the limited functio functions that we don't really use much . {gap} alright take out teletext , but as for channel settings and stuff it might it might um turn people somewhe peop some people that want the whole functionality away . But , since {disfmarker} if we're marketing a more kind of fashionable approach then it'd {disfmarker} it would be fashion and fashion over practicality . </s> Project Manager : Mm-hmm . S s we could {disfmarker} we could make it dual function {gap} voice recognition and {gap} still have buttons on it um </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} Oh , we could , yeah . We c yeah , </s> Project Manager : 'cause we're {disfmarker} </s> Marketing : we could even have it as like a {disfmarker} yeah the buttons control this and the voice functions control the f things that you would do all the time , so . </s> Project Manager : {vocalsound} Certainly could . Yeah , yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : Mm . </s> Marketing : So uh yeah , if we could uh {disfmarker} power on and channel selection and and volume selection , wouldn't have to really {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : {gap} The {disfmarker} I mean the the advantage of doing away the buttons altogether is it makes the thing cheaper . </s> Marketing : Yeah and probably it would look better as well . </s> Project Manager : No , it cou certainly opens up the possibility for making it uh , you know , visually very distinctive . </s> Marketing : Yeah . yeah . </s> Project Manager : Um 'cause you know , it does not have to be a oblong box . </s> Industrial Designer : Mm . </s> Marketing : Lined with numbered buttons and {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : Mm , yeah . Okay , who {disfmarker} sorry , have you have you finished there Andy ? </s> Marketing : Uh yeah , yeah , that's everything . </s> Project Manager : Yep , yep . Um {vocalsound} given that we've already had a extensive discussion uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} . </s> Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} </s> User Interface : {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} </s> User Interface : Okay well , I can do mine . </s> Industrial Designer : Hmm . </s> Marketing : Do you want the cable ? </s> User Interface : Yeah , let's see if I can make this work . Um . </s> Industrial Designer : Oh , you have to hit like function and F_ something . </s> User Interface : Oh . </s> Marketing : F_ eight . </s> Industrial Designer : F_ eight . </s> User Interface : Is it doing {disfmarker} </s> Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Dunno . </s> Marketing : Uh , give it about twenty seconds , or so . </s> User Interface : Okay . </s> Project Manager : Ah , there we go . {vocalsound} </s> Industrial Designer : Oh yeah , it's going . </s> User Interface : Oh okay . {vocalsound} Okay , so this is just about the technical functions . </s> Project Manager : Alright . </s> User Interface : So the method , I looked online for examples of other similar products and then just kind of was trying to brainstorm some possible design ideas and um identify what the necessary things are , what people are {disfmarker} what you really wanna have a remote control do . Um and then there are two different kinds that I found . There's a user centred one and an engineering centred one which I will have pictures of and then we kinda have to decide which one this should be . </s> Project Manager : Mm-hmm . </s> User Interface : {vocalsound} So these are the two different ones . This one um {disfmarker} this is the user centred , it has uh quite a few mm uh um fewer buttons </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} </s> User Interface : and then this is the engineering centred , which has a lot more buttons , </s> Project Manager : Mm-hmm . </s> User Interface : and probably this is one that people complain about , about having too many buttons that you don't use . So basically , what a remote control is is you {disfmarker} it's to send messages to the television set , you know , turn on , off , switch the channels and the volume and things such as that . And so for this product it's gonna be television only , and then it has to have the uh logos for the company and the colours . And so , for my personal preferences , I think this one is easier to use and has quite a {disfmarker} you know , fewer buttons . Um we want something that sends messages easily to the television and I was kind of wondering about this example that they have . It looks kind of narrow at the top , and I was thinking maybe if it were wider at the top , </s> Project Manager : Mm , yeah . </s> User Interface : then that would be easier . Um {vocalsound} and so we have to decide what's gonna make our product different . E the unique style , maybe have it light up so it's visible in the dark , um the changeable face-plates , and the lighting up and visible I was {disfmarker} when we were talking about havi losing it , maybe to have a button on the television that you press and it {disfmarker} maybe if it makes a noise or lights up or something like that , so it's easier to find if someone has hidden under the couch or something like that . So that's my presentation . Yeah .",

We have established a specific programme to develop Welsh language skills in the childcare and play workforce with the National Centre for Learning Welsh, to develop workplace Welsh language skills across the sector. So, we're actually working with that, and I think you've done something with those recently, haven't you? I don't know if you want to\u2014 </s> Nicola Edwards : Yes. So, we have a stakeholder group where we've brought together a variety of people with an interest in the early years, childcare and play sectors, and we had a presentation just last month from the national language centre about the education programmes that they're rolling out, and how this is all coming together, which is quite interesting. We've been working quite carefully to make sure that the variety of work-based learning programmes that we provide and offer are also available in Welsh and bilingually. Recruitment and retention within the childcare and play sector is quite challenging in any\u00a0 case. Recruiting and retaining staff with really good Welsh language skills adds an extra dimension to it, and\u00a0that it's a point that Mudiad Meithrin makes to us quite regularly, that they do struggle to find staff with the right skills. So, upskilling the existing workforce is a key part of it, but also doing more to attract people in with Welsh language skills in the first place in terms of the training courses that we're taking forward, and thinking about that in the context of the targets within Cymraeg 2050 and the aim to get to one million Welsh speakers. So, as the Deputy Minister said, we've got quite a number of children accessing the offer in Welsh-medium or bilingual settings at the moment. We're going to be doing some baselining work against that in terms of local authorities' Welsh in education strategic plans and education places, and what we can then do to increase the number of childcare places in parallel with that so that you can make sure that you start that pathway through learning Welsh, interacting with education and childcare through Welsh at a much earlier stage. </s> Lynne Neagle AM : Suzy, you've got a supplementary. </s> Suzy Davies AM : Just on this early point, anybody who's been through the Welsh education system, which is 20 years now, will have some Welsh language skills, obviously to differing degrees. For the entrants that are coming into childcare training now, there are going to be very few of them, realistically, with no Welsh at all, so what's actually being incorporated into the early years care training to make sure, at that stage, that the Welsh language skills are being developed, as opposed to an add-on later on? </s> Nicola Edwards : You're quite right. Most people coming through the education system will have some awareness of Welsh although I think it's probably important to remember we do also employ people from outside of wales. </s> Suzy Davies AM : Yes, but the majority, being realistic. </s> Nicola Edwards : But they don't necessarily have Welsh that is appropriate. They've got Welsh that they've developed in school. It's not necessarily appropriate for then teaching that language to children, who may be coming from families who don't use Welsh at home. So, that might be the first interaction that child has with the language. So, there's a lot of that in terms of child development and how you develop children bilingually, particularly if they're coming from English-medium homes, and reinforcing the language in language choices. There will also be some people who are, perhaps\u2014we see this quite a lot in the office\u2014quite confident in terms of speaking Welsh but less so in terms of some of the paperwork, the reporting, the writing and the interacting with parents more officially, which we need to think about as well. But it is mainly about getting people to a point where they can transmit that language onwards in a confident and meaningful way. </s> Suzy Davies AM : Okay. And it's ingrained in the early years training. </s> Nicola Edwards : Yes. </s> Suzy Davies AM : Okay. That's fine. Thank you for that. Thank you, Chair. </s> Lynne Neagle AM : Just before we move on, you said that 29 per cent of the take-up of the childcare offer is either through Welsh or is bilingual. Have you got any figures about how many children are accessing it in Welsh only? </s> Nicola Edwards : We will have. It becomes\u2014. With the way we do it, it's because of the way that the setting defines their language category, and that's how we collect it. We do go down to individual child level, although it's anonymised, data collection on a termly basis. So I'll have a look and see if we can send you through the last term. </s> Lynne Neagle AM : Maybe if the committee could have a note, that would be really useful. </s> Nicola Edwards : Yes, that's fine. </s> Lynne Neagle AM : We've got some questions now on childcare from Dawn Bowden. </s> Dawn Bowden AM : Thank you, Chair. Deputy Minister, the evaluation of the childcare offer, when it was published last year, said that there was very little evidence currently available to determine what its impact was. You're going to be producing a second evaluation in November this year; do you expect to see some indications now of the impact? </s> Julie Morgan AM : Well, the evaluation of the first year of the childcare offer was very limited, because the childcare offer wasn't available throughout the whole of Wales. And it was a very early implementation phase. So, obviously it takes time to grow. And the evaluation for year 2, I think, will also show a limited impact for the same reasons. The offer became available across the whole of Wales only last April. So we've only got since last April that it's actually been fully available. And the parental survey was released to parents in June 2019, therefore any impact on parents in the authorities coming on board in the second year will also be negligible. So, it's from the next one, however, we hope that we will get more information. </s> Dawn Bowden AM : So you think, by the time we get to November 2020, you might have a better picture. </s> Julie Morgan AM : The evaluation will be more meaningful, we think, then, yes.",

Recruiting and retaining staff with really good Welsh language skills adds an extra dimension to it, and\u00a0that it's a point that Mudiad Meithrin makes to us quite regularly, that they do struggle to find staff with the right skills. So, upskilling the existing workforce is a key part of it, but also doing more to attract people in with Welsh language skills in the first place in terms of the training courses that we're taking forward, and thinking about that in the context of the targets within Cymraeg 2050 and the aim to get to one million Welsh speakers. So, as the Deputy Minister said, we've got quite a number of children accessing the offer in Welsh-medium or bilingual settings at the moment. We're going to be doing some baselining work against that in terms of local authorities' Welsh in education strategic plans and education places, and what we can then do to increase the number of childcare places in parallel with that so that you can make sure that you start that pathway through learning Welsh, interacting with education and childcare through Welsh at a much earlier stage. </s> Lynne Neagle AM : Suzy, you've got a supplementary. </s> Suzy Davies AM : Just on this early point, anybody who's been through the Welsh education system, which is 20 years now, will have some Welsh language skills, obviously to differing degrees. For the entrants that are coming into childcare training now, there are going to be very few of them, realistically, with no Welsh at all, so what's actually being incorporated into the early years care training to make sure, at that stage, that the Welsh language skills are being developed, as opposed to an add-on later on? </s> Nicola Edwards : You're quite right. Most people coming through the education system will have some awareness of Welsh although I think it's probably important to remember we do also employ people from outside of wales. </s> Suzy Davies AM : Yes, but the majority, being realistic. </s> Nicola Edwards : But they don't necessarily have Welsh that is appropriate. They've got Welsh that they've developed in school. It's not necessarily appropriate for then teaching that language to children, who may be coming from families who don't use Welsh at home. So, that might be the first interaction that child has with the language. So, there's a lot of that in terms of child development and how you develop children bilingually, particularly if they're coming from English-medium homes, and reinforcing the language in language choices. There will also be some people who are, perhaps\u2014we see this quite a lot in the office\u2014quite confident in terms of speaking Welsh but less so in terms of some of the paperwork, the reporting, the writing and the interacting with parents more officially, which we need to think about as well. But it is mainly about getting people to a point where they can transmit that language onwards in a confident and meaningful way. </s> Suzy Davies AM : Okay. And it's ingrained in the early years training. </s> Nicola Edwards : Yes. </s> Suzy Davies AM : Okay. That's fine. Thank you for that. Thank you, Chair. </s> Lynne Neagle AM : Just before we move on, you said that 29 per cent of the take-up of the childcare offer is either through Welsh or is bilingual. Have you got any figures about how many children are accessing it in Welsh only? </s> Nicola Edwards : We will have. It becomes\u2014. With the way we do it, it's because of the way that the setting defines their language category, and that's how we collect it. We do go down to individual child level, although it's anonymised, data collection on a termly basis. So I'll have a look and see if we can send you through the last term. </s> Lynne Neagle AM : Maybe if the committee could have a note, that would be really useful. </s> Nicola Edwards : Yes, that's fine. </s> Lynne Neagle AM : We've got some questions now on childcare from Dawn Bowden. </s> Dawn Bowden AM : Thank you, Chair. Deputy Minister, the evaluation of the childcare offer, when it was published last year, said that there was very little evidence currently available to determine what its impact was. You're going to be producing a second evaluation in November this year; do you expect to see some indications now of the impact? </s> Julie Morgan AM : Well, the evaluation of the first year of the childcare offer was very limited, because the childcare offer wasn't available throughout the whole of Wales. And it was a very early implementation phase. So, obviously it takes time to grow. And the evaluation for year 2, I think, will also show a limited impact for the same reasons. The offer became available across the whole of Wales only last April. So we've only got since last April that it's actually been fully available. And the parental survey was released to parents in June 2019, therefore any impact on parents in the authorities coming on board in the second year will also be negligible. So, it's from the next one, however, we hope that we will get more information. </s> Dawn Bowden AM : So you think, by the time we get to November 2020, you might have a better picture. </s> Julie Morgan AM : The evaluation will be more meaningful, we think, then, yes.",

And I mean , how much does the product demonstrate technical innovation do you reckon ? </s> Industrial Designer : Um , {gap} deciding between the kinetic power or um the speech recognition , and if we had either of those for our budget , they both show a reasonable amount of speech recognition . </s> Marketing : D yeah . Okay . So , what about the pr The prototype as it is , </s> Industrial Designer : Um {disfmarker} </s> Marketing : we've got we've got the speech recognition on it , haven't we . </s> Industrial Designer : But not the kinetic . </s> Marketing : But not the kinetic . </s> Industrial Designer : Like the power . </s> Project Manager : No .

Yeah . </s> Project Manager : Well , wait a minute . In thirteen point seven we do have kinetic . </s> User Interface : I would give it more than a four . </s> Project Manager : The problem is we have to reduce down from there to get it down to twelve point five . </s> Industrial Designer : Right . </s> Project Manager : And one way of doing that would be to take out the kinetic . </s> Industrial Designer : Okay . </s> Project Manager : So , it's very much dependant on what you do with your options . And if you're definitely going for the sample sensor and sample speaker , then {disfmarker} because that {vocalsound} </s> Industrial Designer : 'Kay . </s> Marketing : Right , okay . </s> Project Manager : the other functions we've got in are are more at the {vocalsound} {disfmarker} The special material , the rubber , wood , titanium , et cetera , if you go for that , th that's at the high end 'cause that's point six , whereas down at uh just special colours uh is point two . Now you're trying to lose one point two , so it seems to me that if you're going for the sample sensors {disfmarker} speaker , you're basically then having to go for the cheaper options on everything else . </s> Marketing : Mm-hmm . </s> Industrial Designer : Okay . </s> Project Manager : And and the simple way to do it would be to have a battery , to have your uh sample sensor speaker , </s> Industrial Designer : Um {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : and then you're looking to uh take out uh point two , </s> Marketing : S I'm just gonna check my email . {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : which would be {disfmarker} come from the button supplements category . </s> Marketing : I'm just gonna check exactly what it said in the email for um the product . </s> User Interface : How much of a difference would it make if we made the case in plastic ?

If the buttons are rubber that might be spongy enough . </s> Project Manager : Um , interface type um , </s> User Interface : And then it stand the test of time better . </s> Project Manager : well plastic rather than rubber . {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : Okay . But I {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : That that that would make the significant difference .

Yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : Um , {vocalsound} sorry that'd be considered fancy . </s> User Interface : Yeah , I'd maybe give it a a two . </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} Of {disfmarker} but I think {disfmarker} What {disfmarker} Is one false , or is t one true ? </s> User Interface : One's true . </s> Marketing : I forgot . One's true , and okay . Seven's fal </s> User Interface : And a four is neutral . </s> Marketing : Four is neutral , okay . So {disfmarker} </s> Industrial Designer : So maybe {gap} maybe a two . </s> User Interface : Yeah , 'cause we haven't got the double curve , so we can't like say it's completely true . </s> Project Manager : {vocalsound} Go for one . {vocalsound} Yep . </s> Marketing : Right . </s> User Interface : {vocalsound} But it's pretty close . We've got almost everything we can . </s> Marketing : Okay . Right . </s> Project Manager : Okay . </s> Marketing : I gonna put underneath so I've got some more space . So , false is seven , true is one , and {disfmarker} So uh say about a two for fancy , </s> Industrial Designer : Yeah . </s> User Interface : Yeah . </s> Marketing : you think ? </s> Project Manager : Yeah , why not not , </s> Marketing : Okay . </s> Project Manager : m m maybe nearer three . </s> Marketing : Okay , well d you do an average at the end , I don't know . Um {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : Two three . Well , it's just that uh saying something {disfmarker} {vocalsound} remember that when you look down , we've got solar power , we've got uh various other things you could have , and we're not going for these options . </s> Marketing : Uh-huh . This this is just this is just for like the look . Does it sort of look fancy rather than functional . So {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : Mm-hmm . {vocalsound} </s> User Interface : Yeah , I suppose that might be in the technical innovation bit . </s> Marketing : Yeah , so that {disfmarker} so sh should we go for a a two on that ? </s> Project Manager : Okay . </s> Marketing : 'Kay . And I mean , how much does the product demonstrate technical innovation do you reckon ? </s> Industrial Designer : Um , {gap} deciding between the kinetic power or um the speech recognition , and if we had either of those for our budget , they both show a reasonable amount of speech recognition . </s> Marketing : D yeah . Okay . So , what about the pr The prototype as it is , </s> Industrial Designer : Um {disfmarker} </s> Marketing : we've got we've got the speech recognition on it , haven't we . </s> Industrial Designer : But not the kinetic . </s> Marketing : But not the kinetic . </s> Industrial Designer : Like the power . </s> Project Manager : No . 'Cause you can't afford that {disfmarker} w we took that out too . </s> Industrial Designer : No , we c ca yeah , we can't afford both . </s> Marketing : Alright , so {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : Didn't you ? Or {disfmarker} </s> Marketing : So it doesn't {disfmarker} It's pretty {disfmarker} The prototype as it is isn't sort of um fulfilling the {disfmarker} </s> Industrial Designer : No may is {disfmarker} maybe about neutral </s> User Interface : Maybe a three . </s> Industrial Designer : plus it it it's got something , but it hasn't got {disfmarker} </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} Okay . Yeah . </s> Project Manager : Well , wait a minute . In thirteen point seven we do have kinetic . </s> User Interface : I would give it more than a four . </s> Project Manager : The problem is we have to reduce down from there to get it down to twelve point five . </s> Industrial Designer : Right . </s> Project Manager : And one way of doing that would be to take out the kinetic . </s> Industrial Designer : Okay . </s> Project Manager : So , it's very much dependant on what you do with your options . And if you're definitely going for the sample sensor and sample speaker , then {disfmarker} because that {vocalsound} </s> Industrial Designer : 'Kay . </s> Marketing : Right , okay . </s> Project Manager : the other functions we've got in are are more at the {vocalsound} {disfmarker} The special material , the rubber , wood , titanium , et cetera , if you go for that , th that's at the high end 'cause that's point six , whereas down at uh just special colours uh is point two . Now you're trying to lose one point two , so it seems to me that if you're going for the sample sensors {disfmarker} speaker , you're basically then having to go for the cheaper options on everything else . </s> Marketing : Mm-hmm . </s> Industrial Designer : Okay . </s> Project Manager : And and the simple way to do it would be to have a battery , to have your uh sample sensor speaker , </s> Industrial Designer : Um {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : and then you're looking to uh take out uh point two , </s> Marketing : S I'm just gonna check my email . {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : which would be {disfmarker} come from the button supplements category . </s> Marketing : I'm just gonna check exactly what it said in the email for um the product . </s> User Interface : How much of a difference would it make if we made the case in plastic ? Because we did say that we don't wanna follow the fashion too much . If the buttons are rubber that might be spongy enough . </s> Project Manager : Um , interface type um , </s> User Interface : And then it stand the test of time better . </s> Project Manager : well plastic rather than rubber . {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : Okay . But I {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : That that that would make the significant difference . You could either {vocalsound} you could have it {disfmarker} If you have a in plastic rather than rubber , then that would uh enable you to get {disfmarker} you could keep kinetic then , you could keep your sample sensor , and you'd be looking to take out point two .

I don't know whether we're doing it in the wrong order or something or . </s> Project Manager : Well , okay , but {disfmarker} </s> User Interface : Well , I suppose it's rubber as it is , isn't it . </s> Project Manager : It's rubber as it is , yes . </s> Marketing : So , I mean does this need to go up a bit or something , 'cause we've got both the both the um the speech {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : We got {disfmarker} we've we've got thirteen point seven </s> User Interface : Yeah . </s> Project Manager : and we've got it in at the moment and if {disfmarker} and basically , we're going to reduce down from that . </s> Marketing : Yeah . </s> Project Manager : But the current one , you'd say would be fancy , would be too {disfmarker} {vocalsound} </s> Industrial Designer : Yeah , yeah . </s> Marketing : Yeah . Um , for for innovation , so we've got the speech the speech thing , and {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : {vocalsound} Mm-hmm . I would've said about a two as well . </s> Marketing : Do you reckon a two ? </s> User Interface : Yeah , two or three . I'd be happy with a two . </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} Okay .

Sorry , do you want that back up ? </s> Marketing : Yeah , I just had a presentation to do . {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : Right . </s> User Interface : But I do think uh the v uh voice recognition thing would be more impressive than the fact that it's got no battery . </s> Project Manager : Okay , but remember the main {disfmarker} the only reason we were planning on having the voice recognition was so that they could find the remote if it got lost . </s> Marketing : Mm-hmm . Mm . {vocalsound} Right okay um , This is about the evaluation criteria that we use for the the prototype we've got here . </s> User Interface : {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : And so the method is that the design team makes a prototype , and we evaluate the prototype against some criteria that we've formulated . And those ones are gonna be in response to sort of market research , and also finance , I guess . {vocalsound} And do that on a scale from say true being one and false being seven , so if it's neither true nor false , then that's four . So , I got a set of criteria just based on the marketing that we need to add in a financial one as well , at the end .

Sorry , do you want that back up ? </s> Marketing : Yeah , I just had a presentation to do . {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : Right . </s> User Interface : But I do think uh the v uh voice recognition thing would be more impressive than the fact that it's got no battery . </s> Project Manager : Okay , but remember the main {disfmarker} the only reason we were planning on having the voice recognition was so that they could find the remote if it got lost . </s> Marketing : Mm-hmm . Mm . {vocalsound} Right okay um , This is about the evaluation criteria that we use for the the prototype we've got here . </s> User Interface : {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : And so the method is that the design team makes a prototype , and we evaluate the prototype against some criteria that we've formulated . And those ones are gonna be in response to sort of market research , and also finance , I guess . {vocalsound} And do that on a scale from say true being one and false being seven , so if it's neither true nor false , then that's four . So , I got a set of criteria just based on the marketing that we need to add in a financial one as well , at the end . Um so , We have to say whether it's true or false that the product looks and feels fancy . Um {disfmarker} The {disfmarker} whether the product demonstrates technical innovation . Whether it's easy to use . Whether it's incorporating sort of the fashion element to attract the buyer . And whether it's a sort of recognisable Real Reaction product . And I have to go up onto the whiteboard and do this apparently , </s> Industrial Designer : Okay . </s> Marketing : so {vocalsound} I'll go over here . {vocalsound} Right . So the first one is um , does the product look and feel fancy . So if we do a sort of a one {disfmarker} So {disfmarker} </s> Industrial Designer : Okay , well we have a single curve , which was {gap} maybe like the feel of the product's quite good . </s> Marketing : Yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : So uh {disfmarker} </s> Marketing : Okay . </s> Industrial Designer : Um , then we have the rubber kinda spongy feel , which was in at the time . </s> Marketing : Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : Um , {vocalsound} sorry that'd be considered fancy . </s> User Interface : Yeah , I'd maybe give it a a two . </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} Of {disfmarker} but I think {disfmarker} What {disfmarker} Is one false , or is t one true ? </s> User Interface : One's true . </s> Marketing : I forgot . One's true , and okay . Seven's fal </s> User Interface : And a four is neutral . </s> Marketing : Four is neutral , okay . So {disfmarker} </s> Industrial Designer : So maybe {gap} maybe a two . </s> User Interface : Yeah , 'cause we haven't got the double curve , so we can't like say it's completely true . </s> Project Manager : {vocalsound} Go for one . {vocalsound} Yep . </s> Marketing : Right . </s> User Interface : {vocalsound} But it's pretty close . We've got almost everything we can . </s> Marketing : Okay . Right . </s> Project Manager : Okay . </s> Marketing : I gonna put underneath so I've got some more space . So , false is seven , true is one , and {disfmarker} So uh say about a two for fancy , </s> Industrial Designer : Yeah . </s> User Interface : Yeah . </s> Marketing : you think ? </s> Project Manager : Yeah , why not not , </s> Marketing : Okay . </s> Project Manager : m m maybe nearer three . </s> Marketing : Okay , well d you do an average at the end , I don't know . Um {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : Two three . Well , it's just that uh saying something {disfmarker} {vocalsound} remember that when you look down , we've got solar power , we've got uh various other things you could have , and we're not going for these options . </s> Marketing : Uh-huh . This this is just this is just for like the look . Does it sort of look fancy rather than functional . So {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : Mm-hmm . {vocalsound} </s> User Interface : Yeah , I suppose that might be in the technical innovation bit . </s> Marketing : Yeah , so that {disfmarker} so sh should we go for a a two on that ? </s> Project Manager : Okay . </s> Marketing : 'Kay . And I mean , how much does the product demonstrate technical innovation do you reckon ? </s> Industrial Designer : Um , {gap} deciding between the kinetic power or um the speech recognition , and if we had either of those for our budget , they both show a reasonable amount of speech recognition . </s> Marketing : D yeah . Okay . So , what about the pr The prototype as it is , </s> Industrial Designer : Um {disfmarker} </s> Marketing : we've got we've got the speech recognition on it , haven't we . </s> Industrial Designer : But not the kinetic . </s> Marketing : But not the kinetic . </s> Industrial Designer : Like the power . </s> Project Manager : No . 'Cause you can't afford that {disfmarker} w we took that out too . </s> Industrial Designer : No , we c ca yeah , we can't afford both . </s> Marketing : Alright , so {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : Didn't you ? Or {disfmarker} </s> Marketing : So it doesn't {disfmarker} It's pretty {disfmarker} The prototype as it is isn't sort of um fulfilling the {disfmarker} </s> Industrial Designer : No may is {disfmarker} maybe about neutral </s> User Interface : Maybe a three . </s> Industrial Designer : plus it it it's got something , but it hasn't got {disfmarker} </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} Okay . Yeah . </s> Project Manager : Well , wait a minute . In thirteen point seven we do have kinetic . </s> User Interface : I would give it more than a four . </s> Project Manager : The problem is we have to reduce down from there to get it down to twelve point five . </s> Industrial Designer : Right . </s> Project Manager : And one way of doing that would be to take out the kinetic . </s> Industrial Designer : Okay . </s> Project Manager : So , it's very much dependant on what you do with your options . And if you're definitely going for the sample sensor and sample speaker , then {disfmarker} because that {vocalsound} </s> Industrial Designer : 'Kay . </s> Marketing : Right , okay . </s> Project Manager : the other functions we've got in are are more at the {vocalsound} {disfmarker} The special material , the rubber , wood , titanium , et cetera , if you go for that , th that's at the high end 'cause that's point six , whereas down at uh just special colours uh is point two . Now you're trying to lose one point two , so it seems to me that if you're going for the sample sensors {disfmarker} speaker , you're basically then having to go for the cheaper options on everything else . </s> Marketing : Mm-hmm . </s> Industrial Designer : Okay . </s> Project Manager : And and the simple way to do it would be to have a battery , to have your uh sample sensor speaker , </s> Industrial Designer : Um {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : and then you're looking to uh take out uh point two , </s> Marketing : S I'm just gonna check my email . {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : which would be {disfmarker} come from the button supplements category . </s> Marketing : I'm just gonna check exactly what it said in the email for um the product . </s> User Interface : How much of a difference would it make if we made the case in plastic ? Because we did say that we don't wanna follow the fashion too much . If the buttons are rubber that might be spongy enough . </s> Project Manager : Um , interface type um , </s> User Interface : And then it stand the test of time better . </s> Project Manager : well plastic rather than rubber . {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : Okay . But I {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : That that that would make the significant difference . You could either {vocalsound} you could have it {disfmarker} If you have a in plastic rather than rubber , then that would uh enable you to get {disfmarker} you could keep kinetic then , you could keep your sample sensor , and you'd be looking to take out point two . So you could uh fiddle that down your special form at the bottom , or your special colour at the bottom . </s> Industrial Designer : Mm-hmm . </s> Project Manager : And that would enable you to to do it . </s> User Interface : Mm-hmm . </s> Marketing : Okay . </s> Industrial Designer : So it says if we make a slightly more fancy , then we lose points innovation , and if we make it more innovative innovative , then we lose points on it being fancy , so {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : Yeah . </s> Marketing : Yeah . </s> Project Manager : Ye </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} {gap} , I just read the email again and it sort of says it's evaluate the design sort of as it is , I think , so I think we need to think about finance after we've sort of evaluated that design . I don't know whether we're doing it in the wrong order or something or . </s> Project Manager : Well , okay , but {disfmarker} </s> User Interface : Well , I suppose it's rubber as it is , isn't it . </s> Project Manager : It's rubber as it is , yes . </s> Marketing : So , I mean does this need to go up a bit or something , 'cause we've got both the both the um the speech {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : We got {disfmarker} we've we've got thirteen point seven </s> User Interface : Yeah . </s> Project Manager : and we've got it in at the moment and if {disfmarker} and basically , we're going to reduce down from that . </s> Marketing : Yeah . </s> Project Manager : But the current one , you'd say would be fancy , would be too {disfmarker} {vocalsound} </s> Industrial Designer : Yeah , yeah . </s> Marketing : Yeah . Um , for for innovation , so we've got the speech the speech thing , and {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : {vocalsound} Mm-hmm . I would've said about a two as well . </s> Marketing : Do you reckon a two ? </s> User Interface : Yeah , two or three . I'd be happy with a two . </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} Okay . Two . </s> Project Manager : Oh . </s> Marketing : And the next one is {disfmarker} I'll have to get it back up now . {vocalsound} </s> User Interface : {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : The next on Well , I can just sing about . Easy to use . I would've said yes . I would go for a one on that at this point in time . </s> User Interface : Yeah . Yeah , </s> Marketing : Okay . </s> User Interface : I would say so as well . </s> Project Manager : Um , incorporates elements of fashion to attract buyer . Well , yeah it certainly has some . </s> Industrial Designer : Um {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : {vocalsound} {gap} . </s> User Interface : Yeah , it's got the cherry and the sponginess . </s> Industrial Designer : It does , yeah . </s> Marketing : Um {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : Yep . </s> Marketing : Say about a three maybe ? </s> Project Manager : I don't know . </s> Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Yeah , m um {disfmarker} </s> User Interface : Maybe two ? </s> Industrial Designer : Yeah , it was just doing it quite well . </s> Project Manager : Yep . </s> Industrial Designer : Um , I think we're gonna have to lose some of these , but the moment , as it stands , it's um {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : Yeah , I woulda said two would seem reasonable . </s> Marketing : It's a two . </s> Project Manager : The product is a recognisable real {disfmarker} r uh {disfmarker} reaction product ? </s> Marketing : Yeah , this is {disfmarker} </s> Industrial Designer : Uh {gap} the sensor using all of its all of its products , all of its buttons , </s> Marketing : This {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : {vocalsound} </s> Industrial Designer : and it's got a fairly big label on the bottom saying where it comes from . </s> User Interface : Yeah , that's a bit rough at the minute . {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : Yeah . {vocalsound} So this is about sort of the corporate image of like new sort of sleek technology and all that sort of thing , as well as having the logo on and all that . </s> Project Manager : Oh . </s> Industrial Designer : Okay . </s> Marketing : So {gap} sort of {disfmarker} Is it sort of a recognisable product . </s> Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : Does it fit in with our other other products , which uh are sort of coffee makers and spacecraft . {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : {vocalsound} S </s> User Interface : {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} </s> User Interface : Uh , well it's got the same um speech feature as the coffee machine . </s> Marketing : What do y </s> Industrial Designer : Also it's kind of {gap} spongy rubberiness is maybe bit more kinda comfortable than {disfmarker} kinda sleek and new age . </s> Marketing : Yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : Um , it depends which way you look at it . </s> Marketing : Uh-huh . </s> Project Manager : Okay . So we're going for a two , </s> Marketing : So {disfmarker} </s> Industrial Designer : Maybe a kind of three ? Uh d </s> Project Manager : {gap} three ? </s> User Interface : Yeah , two or three . </s> Marketing : Two or three ? </s> User Interface : Well , the logo would be more um recognisable on the actual thing . It's just that the pen wouldn't really write on that paper . </s> Project Manager : Sure . </s> Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} </s> User Interface : But um , I think the logo would definitely be recognisable . </s> Marketing : Yeah . </s> User Interface : And it does have attributes that other products do .

Go for it . </s> Project Manager : Right , okay . </s> Marketing : Two or three . {vocalsound} </s> User Interface : {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : {vocalsound} Two . </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} How {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : Right , come on . That's that decided . </s> Marketing : Two . Okay . </s> Project Manager : Right . So {disfmarker} </s> Marketing : Right . </s> Project Manager : So we're now on to changing it to get it to fit in with the budget requirements , and then {disfmarker} </s> Marketing : Yeah . </s> User Interface : What does {disfmarker} what do all them numbers mean then ?

So yeah , pretty close to a two . </s> Industrial Designer : Yeah , so it's {disfmarker} </s> Marketing : So {disfmarker} So it's {disfmarker} I mean it's pretty good at the moment , but it's gonna get worse , isn't it . </s> Project Manager : Yep . </s> Marketing : But we've gotta try and make sure it doesn't get too bad . </s> Project Manager : Two b two b two {gap} , yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : So should we get {disfmarker} So are {gap} definite {disfmarker} Was it {disfmarker} thirteen point seven was the definite price rule if {gap} has . </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : Yes . </s> Industrial Designer : Okay , so we need to {disfmarker} </s> Marketing : Yeah .",

Makes sense . </s> Industrial Designer : Okay </s> Marketing : Okay . Right um , I have a little thing . So , we've all got a note of {disfmarker} it's thirteen point seven , isn't it , with everything we want on . </s> Project Manager : {gap} . Sorry , do you want that back up ? </s> Marketing : Yeah , I just had a presentation to do . {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : Right . </s> User Interface : But I do think uh the v uh voice recognition thing would be more impressive than the fact that it's got no battery . </s> Project Manager : Okay , but remember the main {disfmarker} the only reason we were planning on having the voice recognition was so that they could find the remote if it got lost . </s> Marketing : Mm-hmm . Mm . {vocalsound} Right okay um , This is about the evaluation criteria that we use for the the prototype we've got here . </s> User Interface : {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : And so the method is that the design team makes a prototype , and we evaluate the prototype against some criteria that we've formulated . And those ones are gonna be in response to sort of market research , and also finance , I guess . {vocalsound} And do that on a scale from say true being one and false being seven , so if it's neither true nor false , then that's four . So , I got a set of criteria just based on the marketing that we need to add in a financial one as well , at the end . Um so , We have to say whether it's true or false that the product looks and feels fancy . Um {disfmarker} The {disfmarker} whether the product demonstrates technical innovation . Whether it's easy to use . Whether it's incorporating sort of the fashion element to attract the buyer . And whether it's a sort of recognisable Real Reaction product . And I have to go up onto the whiteboard and do this apparently , </s> Industrial Designer : Okay . </s> Marketing : so {vocalsound} I'll go over here . {vocalsound} Right . So the first one is um , does the product look and feel fancy . So if we do a sort of a one {disfmarker} So {disfmarker} </s> Industrial Designer : Okay , well we have a single curve , which was {gap} maybe like the feel of the product's quite good . </s> Marketing : Yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : So uh {disfmarker} </s> Marketing : Okay . </s> Industrial Designer : Um , then we have the rubber kinda spongy feel , which was in at the time . </s> Marketing : Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : Um , {vocalsound} sorry that'd be considered fancy . </s> User Interface : Yeah , I'd maybe give it a a two . </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} Of {disfmarker} but I think {disfmarker} What {disfmarker} Is one false , or is t one true ? </s> User Interface : One's true . </s> Marketing : I forgot . One's true , and okay . Seven's fal </s> User Interface : And a four is neutral . </s> Marketing : Four is neutral , okay . So {disfmarker} </s> Industrial Designer : So maybe {gap} maybe a two . </s> User Interface : Yeah , 'cause we haven't got the double curve , so we can't like say it's completely true . </s> Project Manager : {vocalsound} Go for one . {vocalsound} Yep . </s> Marketing : Right . </s> User Interface : {vocalsound} But it's pretty close . We've got almost everything we can . </s> Marketing : Okay . Right . </s> Project Manager : Okay . </s> Marketing : I gonna put underneath so I've got some more space . So , false is seven , true is one , and {disfmarker} So uh say about a two for fancy , </s> Industrial Designer : Yeah . </s> User Interface : Yeah . </s> Marketing : you think ? </s> Project Manager : Yeah , why not not , </s> Marketing : Okay . </s> Project Manager : m m maybe nearer three . </s> Marketing : Okay , well d you do an average at the end , I don't know . Um {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : Two three . Well , it's just that uh saying something {disfmarker} {vocalsound} remember that when you look down , we've got solar power , we've got uh various other things you could have , and we're not going for these options . </s> Marketing : Uh-huh . This this is just this is just for like the look . Does it sort of look fancy rather than functional . So {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : Mm-hmm . {vocalsound} </s> User Interface : Yeah , I suppose that might be in the technical innovation bit . </s> Marketing : Yeah , so that {disfmarker} so sh should we go for a a two on that ? </s> Project Manager : Okay . </s> Marketing : 'Kay . And I mean , how much does the product demonstrate technical innovation do you reckon ? </s> Industrial Designer : Um , {gap} deciding between the kinetic power or um the speech recognition , and if we had either of those for our budget , they both show a reasonable amount of speech recognition . </s> Marketing : D yeah . Okay . So , what about the pr The prototype as it is , </s> Industrial Designer : Um {disfmarker} </s> Marketing : we've got we've got the speech recognition on it , haven't we . </s> Industrial Designer : But not the kinetic . </s> Marketing : But not the kinetic . </s> Industrial Designer : Like the power . </s> Project Manager : No . 'Cause you can't afford that {disfmarker} w we took that out too . </s> Industrial Designer : No , we c ca yeah , we can't afford both . </s> Marketing : Alright , so {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : Didn't you ? Or {disfmarker} </s> Marketing : So it doesn't {disfmarker} It's pretty {disfmarker} The prototype as it is isn't sort of um fulfilling the {disfmarker} </s> Industrial Designer : No may is {disfmarker} maybe about neutral </s> User Interface : Maybe a three . </s> Industrial Designer : plus it it it's got something , but it hasn't got {disfmarker} </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} Okay . Yeah . </s> Project Manager : Well , wait a minute . In thirteen point seven we do have kinetic . </s> User Interface : I would give it more than a four . </s> Project Manager : The problem is we have to reduce down from there to get it down to twelve point five . </s> Industrial Designer : Right . </s> Project Manager : And one way of doing that would be to take out the kinetic . </s> Industrial Designer : Okay . </s> Project Manager : So , it's very much dependant on what you do with your options . And if you're definitely going for the sample sensor and sample speaker , then {disfmarker} because that {vocalsound} </s> Industrial Designer : 'Kay . </s> Marketing : Right , okay . </s> Project Manager : the other functions we've got in are are more at the {vocalsound} {disfmarker} The special material , the rubber , wood , titanium , et cetera , if you go for that , th that's at the high end 'cause that's point six , whereas down at uh just special colours uh is point two . Now you're trying to lose one point two , so it seems to me that if you're going for the sample sensors {disfmarker} speaker , you're basically then having to go for the cheaper options on everything else . </s> Marketing : Mm-hmm . </s> Industrial Designer : Okay . </s> Project Manager : And and the simple way to do it would be to have a battery , to have your uh sample sensor speaker , </s> Industrial Designer : Um {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : and then you're looking to uh take out uh point two , </s> Marketing : S I'm just gonna check my email . {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : which would be {disfmarker} come from the button supplements category . </s> Marketing : I'm just gonna check exactly what it said in the email for um the product . </s> User Interface : How much of a difference would it make if we made the case in plastic ? Because we did say that we don't wanna follow the fashion too much . If the buttons are rubber that might be spongy enough . </s> Project Manager : Um , interface type um , </s> User Interface : And then it stand the test of time better . </s> Project Manager : well plastic rather than rubber . {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : Okay . But I {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : That that that would make the significant difference . You could either {vocalsound} you could have it {disfmarker} If you have a in plastic rather than rubber , then that would uh enable you to get {disfmarker} you could keep kinetic then , you could keep your sample sensor , and you'd be looking to take out point two . So you could uh fiddle that down your special form at the bottom , or your special colour at the bottom . </s> Industrial Designer : Mm-hmm . </s> Project Manager : And that would enable you to to do it . </s> User Interface : Mm-hmm . </s> Marketing : Okay . </s> Industrial Designer : So it says if we make a slightly more fancy , then we lose points innovation , and if we make it more innovative innovative , then we lose points on it being fancy , so {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : Yeah . </s> Marketing : Yeah . </s> Project Manager : Ye </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} {gap} , I just read the email again and it sort of says it's evaluate the design sort of as it is , I think , so I think we need to think about finance after we've sort of evaluated that design . I don't know whether we're doing it in the wrong order or something or . </s> Project Manager : Well , okay , but {disfmarker} </s> User Interface : Well , I suppose it's rubber as it is , isn't it . </s> Project Manager : It's rubber as it is , yes . </s> Marketing : So , I mean does this need to go up a bit or something , 'cause we've got both the both the um the speech {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : We got {disfmarker} we've we've got thirteen point seven </s> User Interface : Yeah . </s> Project Manager : and we've got it in at the moment and if {disfmarker} and basically , we're going to reduce down from that . </s> Marketing : Yeah . </s> Project Manager : But the current one , you'd say would be fancy , would be too {disfmarker} {vocalsound} </s> Industrial Designer : Yeah , yeah . </s> Marketing : Yeah . Um , for for innovation , so we've got the speech the speech thing , and {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : {vocalsound} Mm-hmm . I would've said about a two as well . </s> Marketing : Do you reckon a two ? </s> User Interface : Yeah , two or three . I'd be happy with a two . </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} Okay . Two . </s> Project Manager : Oh . </s> Marketing : And the next one is {disfmarker} I'll have to get it back up now . {vocalsound} </s> User Interface : {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : The next on Well , I can just sing about . Easy to use . I would've said yes . I would go for a one on that at this point in time . </s> User Interface : Yeah . Yeah , </s> Marketing : Okay . </s> User Interface : I would say so as well . </s> Project Manager : Um , incorporates elements of fashion to attract buyer . Well , yeah it certainly has some . </s> Industrial Designer : Um {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : {vocalsound} {gap} . </s> User Interface : Yeah , it's got the cherry and the sponginess . </s> Industrial Designer : It does , yeah . </s> Marketing : Um {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : Yep . </s> Marketing : Say about a three maybe ? </s> Project Manager : I don't know . </s> Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Yeah , m um {disfmarker} </s> User Interface : Maybe two ? </s> Industrial Designer : Yeah , it was just doing it quite well . </s> Project Manager : Yep . </s> Industrial Designer : Um , I think we're gonna have to lose some of these , but the moment , as it stands , it's um {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : Yeah , I woulda said two would seem reasonable . </s> Marketing : It's a two . </s> Project Manager : The product is a recognisable real {disfmarker} r uh {disfmarker} reaction product ? </s> Marketing : Yeah , this is {disfmarker} </s> Industrial Designer : Uh {gap} the sensor using all of its all of its products , all of its buttons , </s> Marketing : This {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : {vocalsound} </s> Industrial Designer : and it's got a fairly big label on the bottom saying where it comes from . </s> User Interface : Yeah , that's a bit rough at the minute . {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : Yeah . {vocalsound} So this is about sort of the corporate image of like new sort of sleek technology and all that sort of thing , as well as having the logo on and all that . </s> Project Manager : Oh . </s> Industrial Designer : Okay . </s> Marketing : So {gap} sort of {disfmarker} Is it sort of a recognisable product . </s> Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : Does it fit in with our other other products , which uh are sort of coffee makers and spacecraft . {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : {vocalsound} S </s> User Interface : {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} </s> User Interface : Uh , well it's got the same um speech feature as the coffee machine . </s> Marketing : What do y </s> Industrial Designer : Also it's kind of {gap} spongy rubberiness is maybe bit more kinda comfortable than {disfmarker} kinda sleek and new age . </s> Marketing : Yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : Um , it depends which way you look at it . </s> Marketing : Uh-huh . </s> Project Manager : Okay . So we're going for a two , </s> Marketing : So {disfmarker} </s> Industrial Designer : Maybe a kind of three ? Uh d </s> Project Manager : {gap} three ? </s> User Interface : Yeah , two or three . </s> Marketing : Two or three ? </s> User Interface : Well , the logo would be more um recognisable on the actual thing . It's just that the pen wouldn't really write on that paper . </s> Project Manager : Sure . </s> Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} </s> User Interface : But um , I think the logo would definitely be recognisable . </s> Marketing : Yeah . </s> User Interface : And it does have attributes that other products do . Two ? Aye . Go for it . </s> Project Manager : Right , okay . </s> Marketing : Two or three . {vocalsound} </s> User Interface : {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : {vocalsound} Two . </s> Marketing : {vocalsound} How {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : Right , come on .

    "article": "Lynne Neagle AM : Okay. Thank you. We've got some questions now on healthy environments from Dawn Bowden. </s> Dawn Bowden AM : Thank you, Chair. In the draft plan, some of the measures in there suggest legislating for restricting price promotions and banning energy drinks, and that sort of thing. Do you think that, if we go down that road, there's going to be time within this Assembly to introduce such legislation? And, if not, what do you think might be the timescale for such legislation? </s> Dr Frank Atherton : It may well be that there are things in Wales that we might wish to legislate on, and you've mentioned two of them, and they're good examples. We would, obviously, need to undertake quite detailed consultation on those and, in a way, we need to mirror what's happening in England and in Scotland\u00a0to some degree around the consultations they're having on energy drinks. We also need to influence the issues that are not devolved to us and we seek to do that. As to your question of legislative time, I'm not really in a position to answer that. What I could say is that legislation may well be one of the outcomes of the consultation. There may well be things that we wish to choose to legislate on. The timing of that will have to be subject to other pressures, and I come back to the point that legislation, of course, is one of the tools that we've got\u2014we need to deploy them all. </s> Dawn Bowden AM : Sure, I understand that, that you could do other things. I know\u2014. We've heard from the Government, on other calls for legislation, that the programme's very tight, certainly for this term, so I was just wondering whether we might get that in, but okay. If I turn now to the planning system\u2014and this might not be something that you have great deal of knowledge of; I'd just welcome your view on this, because, when we discussed with stakeholders, we talked about whether the planning system, for instance, could be used to, as an example, restrict hot food takeaways around schools and so on. Would that be a measure that you would support, something like that? </s> Dr Frank Atherton : I think it's definitely something we want to look at and, of course, that question is asked in the consultation, so we would like to know people's views on that. It's an interesting one. I think there is a question\u2014a really important question\u2014about how we can use the planning system more effectively. I've discussed with Nathan on a number of occasions, with planning colleagues in Welsh Government and in local authorities, about the art of the possible, let's say. There may be things that we could think about and we want to get those ideas through the consultation. The specific question around takeaways, particularly takeaways near schools, is often asked. I was very interested to see, up in the north-east, some time ago, that one of the local authorities up there did put a moratorium on the opening of new fast-food venues near to schools, or indeed in areas where levels of obesity and overweight were particularly high. I understand London is now\u2014some London boroughs are now\u2014experimenting with that as well. So, that gave me comfort, because maybe there are powers within local authorities that can be used more effectively.\u00a0I think my view at the moment is that the jury's kind of out on whether those are effective and how effective they're going to be. But the fact that we have some initiatives around the UK does give us an opportunity to study that and to learn from experience perhaps and then, if it is shown to be beneficial, to think about that here in Wales, yes. </s> Dawn Bowden AM : Sure, because it will only be one of a suite of measures anyway. Of itself, it wouldn't address the problem, but, added to other initiatives, I guess it would. Can I just ask you briefly, then, about community sport infrastructure and, in particular, of new schools? So, Welsh Government, as you know, has ploughed a huge amount of money into the twenty-first century schools programme. What we heard when we spoke to stakeholders recently, particularly headteachers, was that, in some of the new schools that have been built, we haven't had changing rooms and toilet facilities, for instance, built into the new buildings. So, if we're going to try and utilise these buildings for general community activity to get kids and the wider public, actually, more active, do you think that's something that we ought to be building in? Again, not your particular direct area of responsibility, but something that you might have an input into, is that, when we're developing schools, we should be making sure that they have those kinds of facilities so that they become accessible to the wider public.

One of the things that I was really pleased to see in terms of the Public Health (Wales) Act 2017 that was passed a couple of years ago was the use of health impact assessment as a tool, and we're still working on how that will inform policy and how that will be applied in issues such as policy decisions through Government, but also in more downstream issues about how we create the public infrastructure that the public can and should be using. And so I would like to see the use of health impact assessments to a much greater degree to inform those kinds of decisions. If you apply that kind of lens and you take the point, which is inherent in your question, I think, that schools are not just for kids, they're for communities, then you would\u2014it would lead you to a conclusion that you would perhaps design and build them in a different way. So, on a personal basis, I would certainly support your view that we should be looking to use the sports environment in schools in the same way as we use leisure centres.

In the draft plan, some of the measures in there suggest legislating for restricting price promotions and banning energy drinks, and that sort of thing. Do you think that, if we go down that road, there's going to be time within this Assembly to introduce such legislation? And, if not, what do you think might be the timescale for such legislation? </s> Dr Frank Atherton : It may well be that there are things in Wales that we might wish to legislate on, and you've mentioned two of them, and they're good examples. We would, obviously, need to undertake quite detailed consultation on those and, in a way, we need to mirror what's happening in England and in Scotland\u00a0to some degree around the consultations they're having on energy drinks. We also need to influence the issues that are not devolved to us and we seek to do that. As to your question of legislative time, I'm not really in a position to answer that. What I could say is that legislation may well be one of the outcomes of the consultation. There may well be things that we wish to choose to legislate on. The timing of that will have to be subject to other pressures, and I come back to the point that legislation, of course, is one of the tools that we've got\u2014we need to deploy them all. </s> Dawn Bowden AM : Sure, I understand that, that you could do other things. I know\u2014. We've heard from the Government, on other calls for legislation, that the programme's very tight, certainly for this term, so I was just wondering whether we might get that in, but okay. If I turn now to the planning system\u2014and this might not be something that you have great deal of knowledge of; I'd just welcome your view on this, because, when we discussed with stakeholders, we talked about whether the planning system, for instance, could be used to, as an example, restrict hot food takeaways around schools and so on. Would that be a measure that you would support, something like that? </s> Dr Frank Atherton : I think it's definitely something we want to look at and, of course, that question is asked in the consultation, so we would like to know people's views on that. It's an interesting one. I think there is a question\u2014a really important question\u2014about how we can use the planning system more effectively. I've discussed with Nathan on a number of occasions, with planning colleagues in Welsh Government and in local authorities, about the art of the possible, let's say. There may be things that we could think about and we want to get those ideas through the consultation. The specific question around takeaways, particularly takeaways near schools, is often asked. I was very interested to see, up in the north-east, some time ago, that one of the local authorities up there did put a moratorium on the opening of new fast-food venues near to schools, or indeed in areas where levels of obesity and overweight were particularly high. I understand London is now\u2014some London boroughs are now\u2014experimenting with that as well. So, that gave me comfort, because maybe there are powers within local authorities that can be used more effectively.\u00a0I think my view at the moment is that the jury's kind of out on whether those are effective and how effective they're going to be. But the fact that we have some initiatives around the UK does give us an opportunity to study that and to learn from experience perhaps and then, if it is shown to be beneficial, to think about that here in Wales, yes. </s> Dawn Bowden AM : Sure, because it will only be one of a suite of measures anyway. Of itself, it wouldn't address the problem, but, added to other initiatives, I guess it would. Can I just ask you briefly, then, about community sport infrastructure and, in particular, of new schools? So, Welsh Government, as you know, has ploughed a huge amount of money into the twenty-first century schools programme. What we heard when we spoke to stakeholders recently, particularly headteachers, was that, in some of the new schools that have been built, we haven't had changing rooms and toilet facilities, for instance, built into the new buildings. So, if we're going to try and utilise these buildings for general community activity to get kids and the wider public, actually, more active, do you think that's something that we ought to be building in? Again, not your particular direct area of responsibility, but something that you might have an input into, is that, when we're developing schools, we should be making sure that they have those kinds of facilities so that they become accessible to the wider public. Is that something that you would be prepared to make a recommendation around? </s> Dr Frank Atherton : Well, it's certainly a fascinating area and one that I think has a lot of potential.

So we should change this as well . And uh users are actually zapping a lot , so they're using the device intensively , that's something to take into account as well .

So , those numbers are less important then the previous one , but still it has to be taken to count . So last slide .

Okay , </s> User Interface : Then you you put the switch button , </s> Project Manager : but {disfmarker} </s> User Interface : then it switch to another category of functions . Yeah .

    "summary": "The Industrial Designer made a slide presentation to present his new industrial design for the remote control. On a slide, he expressed his will to make it infrared instead of laser. He considered that technology would be better to control the TV and cheaper than laser, with a cost of approximately eight Euros. On the next slides, he explained the remote control would have an infrared bulb and provided some electronic components' explanation. On the last slide, he stated the remote control should be wireless, but this would also raise the question of how to charge it. The User Interface was surprised with the wireless remote-control idea using a wire to charge. The Industrial Designer added it could be both: with a wire or not. The Marketing was very interested in the cost and raised the user's point of view to have a wireless remote control. The project Manager stepped in to ask if a cable between the remote control and the TV would be a good idea and mostly would it be cheaper. The Industrial Designer acknowledged using a wire would be cheaper but less practical. The project Manager focused on the people's point of view if to have it, wireless and believed it would be easier to have a link between the remote control and the television. The Marketing started his presentation. He pointed several issues out: the remote control presented too many buttons, it got often lost in the room, difficult to learn and RSI problems. The Marketing personal preferences were to meet the user needs and to make it fancy to sell more than the concurrent and definitively with fewer buttons. The Project Manager directly asked the User Interface if it would be possible to have fewer buttons and still have the same functionality and a powerful remote control. The User interface answered it would be possible by assigning several functions to the same button.",

True . </s> Project Manager : yeah . </s> Marketing : This you will see in my presentation then . </s> Marketing : So it's it's interesting information , I think . And then um yeah , the remote controls like the one you've shown previously it's not so {disfmarker} doesn't fit the user requirements sometime , because it's too many buttons and so on . So we should change this as well . And uh users are actually zapping a lot , so they're using the device intensively , that's something to take into account as well .

So the di the differen the findings you know what you find inside the re i the the system here inside it is just , you know a bulb and an infrared bulb , so here for example the infrared bulb will be here </s> Project Manager : Mm-hmm . </s> Industrial Designer : and the bulb it will be somewhere inside . </s> Marketing : That might just {disfmarker} So . </s> Industrial Designer : You can go to the next slide . </s> Project Manager : Okay . </s> Industrial Designer : I have some kind of pictures you know , here . You have the b the bulb , it is a blue the blue stuff here and the infrared and the infrared bulb it is the red stuff </s> Project Manager : Yeah . </s> Industrial Designer : you know and so and you have the other subcomponent that are not really here so important , so . </s> Project Manager : What is this ? </s> Industrial Designer : This is in fact some other component that are in between the electrical de the electronic device . </s> Project Manager : Okay . </s> Industrial Designer : Look . But here what I wanted to emphasise it is just you know the bulb and {gap} . </s> Project Manager : Okay . </s> Industrial Designer : So and the next slide , it is the last one it's {disfmarker} So it's {disfmarker} I think it should be wire {vocalsound} wireless re remote con {vocalsound} Because you know , it's easier to manage and you know because you f the b the the battery problem can hold you know will you use a battery or the a wire to connected you . Or maybe some kind of thing that we can have both , but you know , I at my side prefer a wireless . </s> Project Manager : Okay . </s> Marketing : Okay . </s> Industrial Designer : Okay , so if you have some question I didn't answer ? </s> Marketing : What's the average price of this technology then ? </s> Industrial Designer : Well the avera the average prices I think that this technology will cost , I dunno , around eight Euros , so . Or at least you know , the </s> User Interface : So what , the wireless remote control ? There's a wire {vocalsound} with remote control ? {vocalsound} </s> Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} You'd {disfmarker} yes , you can . It's so so bres you have to decide how how you will you know , put some energy inside , so you can think about wireless or you know it's it's a question that we can raise , so . We can think that you know , with the wire , you know , without a wire . We can have both also . </s> User Interface : Okay . </s> Project Manager : So you think that uh {vocalsound} a cable between the remote control {vocalsound} and the T_V_ {vocalsound} {disfmarker} won't be a good idea . </s> Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} </s> User Interface : {vocalsound} Okay . Okay . </s> Project Manager : {vocalsound} No it wou maybe it will be cheaper {vocalsound} I dunno , I just may maybe you making a solu </s> Marketing : But this is what you would like to ask the user first and I don't think the user would be ready to have a {disfmarker} </s> Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : {vocalsound} Yeah , </s> User Interface : {vocalsound} Wireless remote control {vocalsound} . </s> Project Manager : but {disfmarker} </s> Marketing : I don't think {disfmarker} well , yeah , I don't think he would , </s> Industrial Designer : Yeah , but some pa I always want to have you know , </s> Project Manager : {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : but in a sense {disfmarker} </s> Industrial Designer : sometime I want to have wire because you know . </s> Project Manager : Yeah but as Industrial Designer , do you think that it will be feasible to have uh linked or to have link between the remote control and the television ? </s> Industrial Designer : {gap} {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : {vocalsound} I'm just asking you . Do you think it will be cheaper ? </s> Industrial Designer : Uh , {vocalsound} I don't {vocalsound} think it will be too much . </s> User Interface : {vocalsound} </s> Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : {vocalsound} Could you answer please ? {vocalsound} </s> User Interface : Okay . </s> Industrial Designer : Have to think about the question , you know , 'cause it's {disfmarker} I think that you know you can always you know {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : {vocalsound} Okay . </s> Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} I think wha wha with the wire it's mm cheaper but you know the wireless it's more practical , so . </s> Project Manager : Yeah , but I think the wireless problem is more the um David Jordan's problem . </s> User Interface : Mm-hmm . </s> Marketing : The wire ? </s> Project Manager : As it's {disfmarker} yeah . </s> Marketing : Yeah . True . </s> Industrial Designer : Okay , yeah . </s> Project Manager : I think it's more your problem . Mayb maybe you have just to to kind of research or try to ask people if they will like something wireless or not . </s> User Interface : Mm-hmm . </s> Marketing : Uh that's my job . That's the {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : {vocalsound} Okay , {gap} I'm sorry . </s> Marketing : Now the {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : So {disfmarker} </s> Industrial Designer : Yeah but , it should be an agreement , you know , because {disfmarker} even if you can think of the wireless , it is it's it is the job of the {vocalsound} the the g Graphical User Designer , but you know . If it is a lot cheaper and if you want to reach for example some the the money you have , if you want to use , {vocalsound} so {vocalsound} it can be good to have a wireless , it it is a question . </s> Project Manager : {vocalsound} So </s> User Interface : Okay . </s> Project Manager : just think of um the usability . </s> User Interface : Design a wireless remote control . {vocalsound} </s> Project Manager : Yeah . Just think of the problem . If when you have wireless remote control and if you lose it ? </s> User Interface : Yeah . </s> Marketing : Yeah . </s> Project Manager : I think it's would be easier to have {vocalsound} a link between the remote control and the television , </s> Marketing : Well that's actually one of the point , yeah ? True . </s> Project Manager : yeah . </s> Marketing : This you will see in my presentation then . </s> Marketing : So it's it's interesting information , I think . And then um yeah , the remote controls like the one you've shown previously it's not so {disfmarker} doesn't fit the user requirements sometime , because it's too many buttons and so on . So we should change this as well . And uh users are actually zapping a lot , so they're using the device intensively , that's something to take into account as well . And um , you know , ten percent of the buttons are actually used in the remote control . And uh this is one of the main point for me . But I'll come back to it later . 'Kay . Could you go next slide ? Uh , so as you said uh , </s> Project Manager : Mm-hmm . </s> Marketing : remote controls are often lost somewhere in the room . </s> Project Manager : {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : So this is from the experiments we've done , </s> Project Manager : {vocalsound} {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : so if we could solve this problem this would be interesting for the user , I think . Um it takes too much time to learn how to use the remote control for thirty five percent of the people . And uh remote control are really bad for R_S_I_ problems for twenty six percent of the users . </s> Project Manager : {vocalsound} What is R_S_I_ ? </s> Marketing : R_S_I_ is like , when you're using the same um {disfmarker} doing the same movement several times , then you get injured . </s> Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Yeah . </s> Project Manager : Ah um okay . {vocalsound} </s> Marketing : Okay ? So , those numbers are less important then the previous one , but still it has to be taken to count . So last slide . Um so my pres personal preferences for this problem is we have to meet the user needs . If we can make it look fancy then we might sell more than our uh concurrent , okay . </s> Industrial Designer : Okay . </s> Project Manager : Mm-hmm . </s> Marketing : And definitely if it could have less buttons , still maybe the same number of um functions , but less buttons , </s> User Interface : Functions . </s> Marketing : this would definitely be a good way of selling more . Okay . </s> Industrial Designer : Okay . </s> Marketing : So {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : Mm okay . And just to have uh an idea , do you think you as the User Interface Designer to would it be possible to have less buttons and still have the same functionality and to have powerful remote control , you think it's possible ? </s> User Interface : Yeah . </s> Project Manager : Sure ? Yeah ? </s> User Interface : Yeah , I think possible . Because we can {disfmarker} We can uh mix uh several function in one button . </s> Project Manager : Yeah . </s> User Interface : So lets you {disfmarker} then you have less buttons . </s> Project Manager : Yeah , but do you think it will be easy to use ? </s> User Interface : But I'm not sure {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : Because if you have many functions just for one button it would be quite difficult for the user to know . </s> Marketing : Yeah , remember the user is not happy to read the </s> Industrial Designer : The manuals . </s> Project Manager : Yeah , </s> Marketing : manual . </s> Project Manager : I think the {disfmarker} </s> Marketing : It's {disfmarker} </s> User Interface : No you you can have a switch menu , so you can </s> Project Manager : Yeah , but it has to be intuitive . </s> User Interface : well for example {disfmarker} Yeah , I think so . Like for for example you can uh you can category the function i i into several classes . Then for um you can have a switch menu , so you put the switch menu to it it tend to this kind of this category of functions . </s> Project Manager : Yeah , okay . Okay , </s> User Interface : Then you you put the switch button , </s> Project Manager : but {disfmarker} </s> User Interface : then it switch to another category of functions . Yeah . For example , if you have remote control you you can rem you can control your T_V_ and also you can control your uh recorder . </s> Industrial Designer : With a {disfmarker} </s> User Interface : So there's a different functions , but i if you you {disfmarker} there's a button you can switch between control T_V_ and control your recorder .

Okay . </s> Industrial Designer : Okay . </s> Marketing : So {disfmarker} </s> Project Manager : Mm okay . And just to have uh an idea , do you think you as the User Interface Designer to would it be possible to have less buttons and still have the same functionality and to have powerful remote control , you think it's possible ? </s> User Interface : Yeah . </s> Project Manager : Sure ? Yeah ? </s> User Interface : Yeah , I think possible .
