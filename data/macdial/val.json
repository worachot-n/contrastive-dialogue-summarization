      "Lynne Neagle AM : Okay, thank you very much. We've got some questions now on potential unintended consequences, and other matters relating to that, from Hefin David.",
      "Hefin David AM : Can I ask what value you place on the work done by the Wales Institute of Social and Economic Research, Data and Methods and the presentation so far and the paper to be presented by Dr Nigel Newton?",
      "Kirsty Williams AM : I always\u2014and Welsh Government are big supporters of WISERD and the work that they do, and, in fact, we need more research into Welsh education, not less. Therefore, I find their papers really helpful and help us to inform our work. I think what's really important in perhaps this piece of work is to say that I hope that, in the time where I've had an influence to influence over Welsh education, either as a backbencher or now as a Minister, equality and principles of equity have always driven what I've tried to achieve. And I would never undertake a policy reform that I thought would lead to less equity in the Welsh education system. Closing the attainment gap is a core element of the national mission for education in Wales and we would not proceed with anything that we thought could lead to an exacerbation of an achievement gap.",
      "Hefin David AM : Okay. And how do you respond, then\u2014? I mean, it's a balanced paper, it looks at pros and cons and there's a mixed picture from it. How do you respond to the specific statement that Dr Nigel Newton said that the curriculum could exacerbate segregation within schools between different groups of pupils?",
      "Kirsty Williams AM : Well, I think what the paper acknowledges is that there is no evidence that that will happen. These are 'coulds' and 'maybes' and things that we need, as a Government, to take into consideration as we plan this journey. There can't be any empirical research done at the moment because the curriculum isn't being delivered, but I understand, and we need listen to\u2014. If there are concerns out there in the field that these are unintended consequences that we may fall into\u2014that is the value of that piece of research that helps inform us. I have to say, though, the curriculum in itself is neither going to necessarily on its own hugely enhance equity nor detract from equity, in the sense that the curriculum is what's taught in our schools. There is an opportunity, I believe, that empowering teachers to be able to be more flexible in what they teach their children actually gives us an opportunity to deliver lessons that could be much more engaging and much more relevant to some of our schoolchildren than what they have at the moment. What will make the curriculum a success for all of our children, and I believe will have a bigger impact on children who are in danger of being left behind, are the four enabling purposes of the curriculum. So, the curriculum on its own can play a part, but it will only be as good as the four enabling elements that surround it. And that is strong leadership of our schools that ensures that there is no segregation, that has high expectation of all of our children, and delivers a curriculum within that setting that meets the needs of the children there. Secondly: excellent teaching. In the end, no education system, whatever its curriculum, can exceed the quality of the people who stand in front of our children day in, day out. So, the curriculum can be the most exciting, wonderful\u2014and I think it is exciting and I think it's wonderful\u2014it can be the most exciting, wonderful thing in the world, but if teachers can't teach it effectively, if their pedagogy is not excellent, then the content itself\u2014it won't work. Then we've got issues around assessment and accountability. So, how do you assess how children are doing in your new curriculum? How do you understand how that pupil, who has, you know\u2014who could be vulnerable for a whole host of reasons, usually reasons outside of the school\u2014? That pupil is vulnerable. How can you assess how that pupil is and move their learning along in an appropriate fashion? And then, finally, the well-being of the child. People sometimes say, 'Oh, you're going soft\u2014typical, going soft'. But what we know is that we cannot expect children to learn unless we address issues around their well-being. But we also know that poor achievement is also detrimental to a child's well-being. There's been lots and lots of research done, not in a Welsh context but in other systems, where children are kept behind for a year. That has a massive impact on their well-being. So, good achievement leads to good well-being, but good well-being also leads to good achievement, and you can't separate the two. So, the curriculum on its own will not be enough. It is the four enabling objectives that sit around it, and we have to be cognisant of the WISERD's research, of course we do, to ensure that, as we're doing our professional learning, as we're planning well-being for our children, as we think about assessment methods and how we develop a culture of strong leaders in our schools\u2014and we have some, we have many, but we need to do more to support them\u2014it is that that will make the biggest difference, not just the content of the curriculum on its own. Although I do believe the flexibility that we're allowing people will, I think, lead to a curriculum and more meaningful lessons for some children in schools who are in danger of disengaging because they don't understand why they're being asked to learn what they're learning, they don't see the relevance of what they're learning to what they may want to do or how their lives are, or they don't see themselves reflected. So, for some of our communities, they don't see themselves reflected in the curriculum that we're teaching at the moment. And, again, international research would suggest that, if you want a child to thrive, they have to see themselves and their community reflected in what they're learning in schools.",
      "Hefin David AM : What the WISERD research suggests is that the senior management teams\u2014the management teams\u2014would certainly buy into what you've just said, but the classroom teachers would be a little bit more sceptical.",
      "Kirsty Williams AM : As I said, classroom teachers are absolutely crucial to this, which is why, first of all, we've taken the difficult step to delay the implementation of the curriculum to give us the time that we need to make sure that it's not just school leaders but it is individual classroom practitioners who have the skills that they need to make the most of the opportunity that the curriculum allows them.",
      "Hefin David AM : So, if we look at some of the statements that were in the presentation by WISERD at the seminar two comments jump out: 'We'll end up'\u2014this is from classroom teachers\u2014 'We'll end up with a different accountability framework to the aims and objectives of the new curriculum.' and 'there will be no consistency'. And consistency is the one I'd particularly like to focus on: 'there will be no consistency across all schools in how the new curriculum is delivered which could affect outcomes'.",
      "Kirsty Williams AM : Well, first of all, we've just talked, haven't we, about trying to ensure that there is greater consistency and that's why we're changing our approach to the legislation around the Bill. So, in terms of progression steps, there will be a statutory framework to ensure that progression is the same wherever you are in Wales. So, as I said, we're using this report, we're using this feedback, to inform decisions going forward. In terms of\u2014. Read the first bit again. Was it\u2014[Interruption.] Accountability, yes.",
      "Hefin David AM : Yes: 'different accountability framework to the aims and objectives of the new curriculum.'",
      "Kirsty Williams AM : Okay. So, as always, in education, teachers\u2014understandably, because this is the regime that they have been a part of\u2014immediately don't think about their pedagogy, they think about, 'How are judgments going to be made upon me as an individual?' And what we're trying to do is ensure that we are developing another accountability regime that is indeed in line with the purposes of the curriculum and doesn't work against the purposes of the curriculum. So, I understand why teachers are concerned. They spend a lot of time thinking about accountability and how they're going to be held accountable for their practice, but, again, what we want to do is provide reassurance that we are devising an accountability regime for our system that is in line with the purposes of the curriculum and puts us in line with the mainstream thought and reform process across the world of progressive education systems.",
      "Hefin David AM : It was the segregation bit I was particularly interested in and the response with regard to disadvantaged pupils and pupils of lower attainment.",
      "Kirsty Williams AM : I don't\u2014. I do not believe that any changes\u2014and I would not pursue any changes that\u2014would lead to a segregation.",
      "Hefin David AM : Okay. And with regard to the connection between Welsh Government and local government and the concerns that the Welsh Local Government Association and the Association of Directors of Education Wales raised, what progress\u00a0has been made on bridging the gap between\u2014? Whether it's a perception gap or a practice gap, what progress has been made on that?",
      "Kirsty Williams AM : Well, I think the last time we had this conversation in the committee I said that I think the comments that the WLGA and ADEW had made were reflective of an old piece of work and were not current and up to date, and I think progress had been made in that time, and I'm pleased to report the significant progress that's been made\u2014",
      "Hefin David AM : Bridges have been built.",
      "Kirsty Williams AM : Bridges have been\u2014. Well, from my perspective, the bridges were always there. But we've got renewed, energetic engagement from the WLGA and ADEW in all the arrangements that we have for the development of the curriculum and my understanding is that they have said publicly and in writing that they're very supportive of what's going on.",
      "Hefin David AM : I'm sure they're watching and nodding vigorously now on Senedd.tv.",
      "Kirsty Williams AM : And I will be with them tomorrow night and Friday morning and I'm sure if they've got any other views they'll let me know.",
      "Hefin David AM : And the final question: there is a process, a model for this, which is Scotland. What kind of lessons are being learned from the introduction of their curriculum?",
      "Kirsty Williams AM : Okay. So, I think the first thing to realise is that our curriculum is not a copycat of the Scottish curriculum, but it is always useful to reflect on how other systems have undertaken curriculum reform in their nation and to learn from any issues that have arisen. So, I think it's fair to say\u2014and I spent time with some delegates from Scotland just this weekend at the Atlantic Rim Collaboratory conference that Wales hosted this year. Unfortunately, Minister Swinney was not able to attend at the very last minute because of Brexit preparedness work that he was involved in, but certainly their teaching union and their equivalent of the EWC in Scotland joined us as well as representatives from the Scottish Government, although not John himself, and they were very frank about some of the challenges that they had faced in introducing their curriculum. Part of that is about assessment and they had not really thought\u2014. They spent all their time thinking about content and spent no time at all thinking about assessment. Assessment has been a crucial part of the process that we have been involved in. Professional learning, ensuring that the profession was properly prepared for the changes, I think they would agree that that wasn't necessarily\u2014. The middle tier, which they don't have to the\u2014. Well, they've got local authorities and regions, but whether they were truly engaged in what they were doing. So, I think we've learned\u2014. Although our curriculum isn't a copycat, as I said, we have been able to learn from, and we've had people who have been deeply involved in the Scottish experience as part of some of our curriculum and assessment groups and some of the advice that we've had in terms of developing coherence. But, Steve, I don't know if\u2014. You speak to your Scottish colleagues quite a lot.",
      "Steve Davies : As I said, they're very forthright in sharing their learning and I think one of the critical elements was the extent to which assessment was considered at the outset alongside the curriculum content. So, that was critical, but we've embraced experts who were involved in that process who were part of our curriculum assessment group. So, they feed in throughout\u2014not 'don't do this because Scotland has done it', but they feed some of that learning into the system. As the Minister said, we had seven other countries from across the world giving us feedback and input over four days as to where we can continue to look at what we're doing but also checks and balances against some of their experiences with this area of reform.",
      "Kirsty Williams AM : The particular focus of this year's conference was on the issue of assessment and we were joined by colleagues from Scotland, from Ireland, from Iceland, from Finland, from Saskatchewan, from Nova Scotia and from Uruguay.",
      "Hefin David AM : When did that take place?",
      "Kirsty Williams AM : Where?",
      "Hefin David AM : When.",
      "Kirsty Williams AM : The weekend just gone.",
      "Hefin David AM : Right.",
      "Lynne Neagle AM : Okay, thank you. Suzy. You've got a whole section on assessment, I don't know\u2014",
      "Suzy Davies AM : This isn't about assessment.",
      "Lynne Neagle AM : Oh, okay. Go on, then.",
      "Suzy Davies AM : So, on the basis that this is not about assessment, you mentioned that one of the lessons learned from Scotland is that they said they spent too much time on curriculum content rather than assessment. Can you tell me a little bit about what you've learned about how they quality control the content, even though the content, of course, will be completely different in Wales?",
      "Kirsty Williams AM : Yes, the content would be completely different. When I said they spent too much time, I said that the focus had been in their work about just talking about content and, actually, the assessment arrangements were bolted on at the end of the process. So, the curriculum was all designed and developed, it was sent out to schools, and then the question was raised: 'Oh, actually, what assessment methods\u2014? How are going to assess how children are getting on?' But, Steve, you would have more details of their exact experience of quality control of the content\u2014",
      "Suzy Davies AM : Of the content, because every school is going to be very different at this.",
      "Steve Davies : In terms of developing the guidance and the curriculum going out in January is concerned, I think\u2014again, I don't want to be overly critical, but one of the findings was that they encouraged schools to go forth and multiply in terms of the materials and ideas and concepts that were coming through. What we learnt was to actually\u2014the pioneer movement was to get a smaller group to develop those materials and look to engage through cluster groups. So, we had pioneers who worked with clusters to test the development of that concept before we were looking for schools to go away and develop a larger amount of content. So, in terms of the staging and measuring of bringing together the curriculum and the associated guidance, I think the time we've taken to actually get there and the strategy of using pioneer schools, external experts, back to pioneer schools, back to regions, or engaging regions in that, has been more measured and planned against a planned timescale, where everyone from the outset\u2014with the exception of the extension of the one year\u2014was clear on when we were going to be producing materials that would allow the profession to then take it and use it. I think\u2014. Claire, do you want to add to that, or\u2014?",
      "Claire Bennett : I think, as we move forward, that kind of cluster approach remains really important. So, it's, as schools then think about, 'What am I going to do in my school?', that they're doing that in clusters together. When colleagues from the regional consortia were sharing their thinking with the curriculum assessment group last week, they were talking about the very specific and differentiated, I suppose, professional learning support that they would be offering to schools that have already done quite a lot of thinking and are quite far down this journey and then the kind of different sorts of approaches they would offer schools that are just starting out. Their emphasis was very much on this peer-to-peer sharing and support, so people aren't just going off in isolation. The other thing that will also help in that process will be the national network. So, there'll continue to be a focus for each area of learning and experience, bringing together the professional learning and the ongoing curriculum development, bringing together practitioners and experts and colleagues across the middle tier to give a bit of strategic direction and to be able to identify if there are areas where more support is needed. So, I think that a huge amount of thinking, particularly in the regions, has gone on into the practical support that can be given to schools, not just in engaging with the curriculum now, but then how they take it and think about then developing it in their schools. It feels like\u2014I think Graham Donaldson was calling it a 'slow-burn process'. You don't start in 2022\u2014people are already doing it and there's a lot of thought going into how to support continued sharing through the next two years.",
      "Kirsty Williams AM : And I think that's another difference, you see\u2014that strong middle tier and the role that the middle tier is playing in Wales, which was absent in Scotland. So, this ability to work in networks to provide support to a network of schools, that wasn't available in the Scottish system and I think that makes\u2014I think that helps us in the way that they just simply didn't have a structure that allowed them to do that. It's not a criticism of them; it's just that we have got a structure that we can utilise to do that support so that schools are not completely left on their own and they can be working with other schools, with their regional consortia, going forward.",
      "Suzy Davies AM : Can I just have a quick\u2014?",
      "Lynne Neagle AM : Very quickly, because I want to move on to implementation.",
      "Suzy Davies AM : Yes, sorry, I completely understand. Was one of the things that Scotland did\u2014I don't want to use the word 'assess'\u2014to monitor the pupil response to the curriculum as one of the means of deciding whether curricula in particular schools were working well enough?",
      "Kirsty Williams AM : I don't know if they\u2014. I don't know if they did, but one of the interesting things that we were reflecting on over the weekend is that, certainly some of the Canadian systems, in particular, which we were interested in, used pupil surveys as part of their accountability regime\u2014so, actually taking the time to ask students how they felt, not just about the content of the new curriculum, but actually how they felt their school was doing. And so we're interested in looking, as I said, at some of the practices that other countries use to include pupil voice to find out what's happening.",
      "Suzy Davies AM : Okay, that's interesting. Okay, thank you.",
      "Kirsty Williams AM : Yes. I mean, it's early thoughts, because we've only just heard about it ourselves. But that's the beauty of working with other countries. They found that particular useful and successful, and we're keen to see if we could do something similar."

      "User Interface : Well uh , my name's {gap} , and I looked at uh technical functions design of the remote . Uh I did this by uh looking at examples of other remote controls , of how they uh they look , and information from the web that I found . Um well what I found was that uh th the actual use of the remote control is to send messages to television set , how you uh d what you described uh just early . And this can be all sorts of medsa messages , turn it on , turn it off , uh change the channel , adjust volume , that kind of thing . Uh play video , teletext , but also t uh play C_D_ if you use it your C_D_ player the remote control will that one . There are some uh examples of remote controls . You can see they are very different . The one has got all the functions that you could possibly need and an lot of uh buttons etcetera . And the other is uh more user friendly , little with big buttons . And uh not n all the the the the stuff you can do with it , but uh the the essential stuff is there . Um {vocalsound} I guess you could better y you should look at a a user centred uh approach , because the customers have to use them and and if they don't think it's usable they won't uh buy it . A lot of buttons they may think from I don't need s as much as that . Uh , well perf personal preferences is is uh a simple remote , with uh the basic functions that you can need that you could use . But uh keep in mind the new functions of T_V_ what we discussed earlier , split screen and uh is that a function that you should have ? Because all the T_V_s will have them . Or because of only a few and isn't really necessary . And then uh make it {disfmarker} I would make so that you can could uh use it on more than one appliance . If you have one that uh uh does with the vi the the video , it could also work with uh with the stereo , because play is play and stop stop and that sort of thing . The shu c you could reuse the buttons so that you don't have to have a lot of buttons for uh anything . And it should be a user friendly , clear buttons , and not too much . And that is my presentation .",

      "Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}",
      "Marketing : The methods I I prefer is we're going to look which section of the users we are going to focus a l on more . Are the younger people going to buy the remote control or the elderly people ?

Younger people , from sixteen to thir forty five um years are more interested in fj features like L_C_D_ screens , speech recognition e etcetera . And we possess about two third of the market from in that range of age . The elderly people , from forty five years to sixty five years are not that much interested in features , and we possess less than two third , that's two fifth , of the market share in that area . {gap} Goed so .",

      "Industrial Designer : Mm .",
      "Marketing : and fif seventy five of the users zap a lot , so the buttons sh should be that small , or shouldn't be that complex because we have to search for the buttons , which one are you going to use . Next . Important issues about the remote . I think it would be better with a personal reference , but okay . Remote control has to have to have a low power usage , because s w seventy five percent of the users only zap one time an hour , so the power usage is also one one time an hour , or so , with a high power usage we would use a lot of but batteries . The volume button and the channel buttons are the two most important buttons on the remote control , so those {disfmarker} they {disfmarker} those have to h be find very easily . And have to be somewhat like bigger etcetera . It has also be {disfmarker} have to find easily when the label is gone . My colleague also announced it that labels should be scratched off",

Like what all colleagues said , have to have to be minimalized . or should be covered , or in L_C_D_ screen . L_C_D_ screen is easy because we have the L_C_D_ screen , we have the various options . Put one option and then you have the all the buttons of that options , so the other options would be gone . And you don't see the buttons . So L_C_D_ screens should be easy , but an L_C_D_ screen , the problem with the L_ sc L_C_D_ screen is that elderly people fr from forty five to for sixty five years don't use the L_C_D_ screen a lot .

Because my understanding is that the money is being used in other UK nations to directly impact on obesity. Have you given any consideration to\u2014? As I understand it, that money now is being dispersed around a plethora of programmes, including the transformation programme, and what I found very odd, really, was vaccination, which is surely the core business of the NHS. Have you got any view on that?",

      "Dr Frank Atherton : Well, that cuts to what I was talking about. My preference\u2014it's a personal view\u2014is that hypothecation doesn't really help us too much. I mean, what we need to look at is whether the programmes, the sorts of programmes that are being funded in England, or indeed in Scotland, are working effectively, and if they are, are they being delivered here in Wales? We have looked very carefully at the plans that England and Scotland have for tackling obesity and overweight, and we've made a comparison with what we're doing in Wales, and our ambition in Wales is to go further than those nations, in many ways. But I come back to the point that just linking the hypothecation of a relatively small amount of resource is likely to be less impactful than asking a question of public services boards and of the health system, indeed, about how much money, overall, are we putting into prevention.",

Going into a pot, it actually makes it quite difficult to explain the purpose of the tax in the first place. So, I take your overall point, but in terms of the people who we're trying to help in all this, actually creating a direct link might be quite helpful.",

      "Janet Finch-Saunders AM : Thank you, Chair. Delivery of the plan will be led by a national implementation board that will be accountable to Ministers. Which Minister do you believe it should be accountable to, or, given the complexity of obesity, should the board be directly accountable to the First Minister?",
      "Dr Frank Atherton : Ultimately, the First Minister will be responsible for this and will want to have a strong oversight of this. It is often framed as a health issue, and the Minister, Vaughan Gething, has a strong personal commitment to this, I know. We've talked extensively with him and with sports and recreation colleagues about that, so there's a link there. It does cut across all portfolios, and so this is an issue that I have discussed with Cabinet, and that collective ownership is really important, and will be, because it can't just sit in one domain. I think what you do need to have is you do need to have a lead organisation or a lead ministry, and I would see health as\u2014I work within health, so I'm perhaps biased, but I would see health as leading this, but it needs broad ownership across Government.",
      "Janet Finch-Saunders AM : I know my colleague Si\u00e2n Gwenllian mentioned earlier targets and things, but I know in Wales we're not too good at collecting data. What data is currently available on childhood obesity and what metrics will be used to measure progress against the plan's objectives?",
      "Dr Frank Atherton : Well, of course, our main data source is the child measurement programme, which collects information on children entering school aged four or five. That's our main source of information. If we look at that data, it shows us\u2014. Well, I'm sure you're familiar with the statistics, but it'll be just under a third of children at that age who are overweight or obese\u2014",
      "Janet Finch-Saunders AM : Could I just ask\u2014sorry to interrupt\u2014how up to date is that?",
      "Dr Frank Atherton : The last survey was just last year.",
      "Nathan Cook : The data was published last week.",
      "Dr Frank Atherton : Yes, the lastest data was out last week.",
      "Janet Finch-Saunders AM : It is pretty up to date.",

It's not getting radically worse\u2014there's always statistical variation in these things\u2014but it's not getting any better. And, for the first time last year, we did look at the question not just of children who were overweight or obese, but we actually singled out the proportion who are obese, severely obese. So we have a figure for that for the first time, which is about 12 per cent, which is quite shocking, in a way.",
      "Janet Finch-Saunders AM : It is shocking.",
      "Dr Frank Atherton : So, that's our main source of information. Does that answer your question?",
      "Janet Finch-Saunders AM : Yes, but how will any gaps in your data be addressed?",
      "Dr Frank Atherton : Well, one of the questions that are often asked is: could we measure more on a longitudinal basis? By that I mean in England, for example, children are measured at school entry and then again at year 11\u2014at age 11 or 12., that kind of age group. And so you do have a longitudinal view over time of what's happening to children. I think that would be helpful to us in Wales, and it's one of the questions in the consultation about whether we should expand that. Obviously, that would have significant resource implications, not just for the funding, but also for schools and for the system to deliver it. But it's something that maybe would help us in terms of better understanding and better evaluation\u2014the point that was made earlier.",
      "Nathan Cook : And the other data we do have is the millennium cohort study, which has been released, for 14 and 15-year-olds. That's going to be\u2014. We're starting to think about how we can utilise some of that data, looking at that longitudinal picture around children as well, which will be really helpful.",
      "Janet Finch-Saunders AM : Thank you. You've answered my next question. Thank you.",
      "Lynne Neagle AM : Can I just ask about the child measurement programme? The strategy commits to looking at whether we can have a second measurement taking place in Wales. Can you just tell us a bit more about your thinking on that and when you would see a second measurement taking place and how you would use that data?",
      "Dr Frank Atherton : I touched on that just now, but personally I do think it would be helpful to have more information. It's always the case, There's always a trade-off between the cost of getting that information and the value of the information. So, the question of how it would be used would be really important. There is still a lot that we don't know. We know an awful lot about obesity and being overweight and the causes of it, but we don't really have a very clear understanding, in Wales at least, of the point at which children start to become overweight. Although we know that overweight children tend to go on to become overweight adults, we don't know what proportion of them between school entry and later teenage years\u2014what those changes are. So, it would help us to have some better understanding, which would help to direct some of our initiatives. I'd be generally supportive of the principle. We'll wait and see what comes out in the consultation, and it's something that we need to give thought to,\u00a0 but we do have to trade off the additionality of what the information would give us with the cost of doing that, of course."

      "Professor B : Good .",

And every {disfmarker} every element of that e r r f of that {disfmarker} Every segment we call a \" route element \" . And so , from A to B we cut up in three different steps , and every step has a \" from object \" where you start , a \" to object \" where y where {pause} you sort of end , and some points of interest along the way . What w I was sort of missing here , and uh , maybe it was just me being too stupid , is , {vocalsound} I didn't sort of get the {disfmarker} the notion of the global goal of the whole route .

And I {vocalsound} suggested that they should n be {disfmarker} k uh , kind enough to do s two things for us , is one , um , {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Also allocating , uh , some tags for our Action Schema Enter - Vista - Approach , and {disfmarker} And also , um , since you had suggested that {disfmarker} that , um , we figure out if we ever , for a demo reason , wanted to shortcut directly to the g GIS and the Planner , of how we can do it . Now , what 's the state of the art of getting to entrances , um , what 's the syntax for that , how get getting to {vocalsound} vista points and calculating those on the spot .

      "PhD C : Yeah . Uh , yeah . That {disfmarker} that was one {disfmarker} one {disfmarker} one thing , uh , why I added more mixtures for {disfmarker} for the speech . So I saw that there were loud {disfmarker} loudly speaking speakers and quietly speaking speakers .",

      "PhD C : And four additional features , which is energy , loudness , modified loudness , and zero crossing rate . So it 's twenty - four {disfmarker} twenty - four features .",

      "PhD C : Yeah . You can specify {vocalsound} the minimum length of speech or {disfmarker} and silence portions which you want . And so I did some {disfmarker} some modifications in those parameters , basically changing the minimum {disfmarker} minimum {pause} length for s for silence to have , er to have , um {disfmarker} yeah {disfmarker} to have more or less , uh , silence portions in inserted .

      "Llyr Gruffydd AM : Talking about the impact on the wider economy, on the point you made earlier that it's not just the direct effect on these institutions, but also on the businesses that they engage with, that is a concern in this context, that means, of course, that there is a lot of pressure in this context on the work that other departments in the Government are doing, because perhaps they are the ones dealing with some of this. So, could you tell us a little bit about how you're working with Ministers and Cabinet Secretaries and other departments within the Government to safeguard these interests?",
      "Eluned Morgan AM : So, as part of the employability programme, I have started going round every member of the Cabinet to ask what the impact will be on them\u2014for example, in health, and, certainly, the economy, but here are many other areas. What's important for us is that we do collaborate and we do get this analysis, but we hope to do that on the ground through the regional skills partnerships. That's our way of ensuring that we can have an understanding, on the ground, of what's needed by employers. And so ensuring that people feed into that and that we respond to those requirements\u2014that's where we're focusing our work. So, we're asking, for example, health boards to ensure that they feed into the regional skills partnerships.",
      "Llyr Gruffydd AM : Is there a danger that we're a little bit behind in this process? Because Brexit could be upon us in no time at all, and, of course, this work is still ongoing.",
      "Eluned Morgan AM : Well, I have been pushing and ensuring that in the direct areas facing the greatest risk, and agriculture's one of those, of course\u2014. We have been pushing to see what we can do further, so, for example, I'm in the process of developing a policy on rural skills at present because I do think it's important that we do focus on those sectors that are likely to suffer the worst impact if the worst does happen. So, those preparations are in place as far as they can be, but, of course, it's very difficult without knowing to what extent it's going to impact on us.",
      "Llyr Gruffydd AM : And each sector's running on its own timescale, I would presume. But, as you've mentioned rural skills, when do you foresee that that work will appear, and when will plans or schemes or whatever you're intending to put in place see the light of day?",
      "Eluned Morgan AM : Well, we hope during this term that that will be published or announced. So, certainly, it is something that we have been discussing with people in rural areas directly, with the colleges, to see what the provision is there and to what extent we need to expand that, and to what extent we will need to change and move really quickly if there is no deal. That's something that I think we have to learn and we need to convince the FE sector about in terms of moving more quickly and to be more responsive to the demand that there is in the workplace.",
      "Llyr Gruffydd AM : Yes, because there is the dilemma you touched on earlier about providing the skills that are required for the economy and providing the courses that are easy to fill. That is a live discussion across FE and HE, but you're confident that that discussion is taking place in a constructive and positive way and moving in the right direction.",
      "Eluned Morgan AM : Well, it's helped that we've put \u00a310 million on the table, because they do understand now that we are serious about our aim of ensuring that they do respond to what employers are asking for. So that has helped a lot in terms of focus and, of course, we're in the middle of a review now as well in terms of how we fund FE, and that will certainly be a part of that.",

There could be a scenario where there are reciprocal arrangements, so, if a deal was reached with the European Union that established the principle of reciprocal arrangements, then, obviously, the ability of the HE institutions to charge international fees would be curtailed. I just want to make that clear.",

I should have made it very clear that the answer I gave was in the context of no deal, which is what we seem to be talking about mostly this morning, but if there was a deal to have reciprocal arrangements, then that ability, obviously, would be curtailed.",

No. Okay, well, can I thank the Cabinet Secretary, the Minister and the officials for attending and for answering all our questions? We very much appreciate your time. As usual, you'll be sent a transcript to check for accuracy after the meeting. Thank you very much. Okay. Item 5, then, is papers to note. Members will see that there are 18 papers to note, so I'd like to suggest that we note them as a block, please, and just to flag that I would like to return to paper to note 18 when we go into private. Is that okay with everyone? Everyone happy to note those? Thank you. Item 6, then, can I propose, in accordance with Standing Order 17.42, that the committee resolves to meet in private for the remainder of the meeting and the whole of the meeting next week? Are Members content? Okay, thank you."

      "Lynne Neagle AM : Okay. Okay, thank you. We've got some questions now specifically on prosecutions and potential alternatives from Vikki Howells.",
      "Vikki Howells AM : Thank you, Chair. You've already touched quite a bit on the issue of the public interest test. Is there anything else you'd like to put on record about the factors that the CPS would be taking into consideration when applying the public interest test in respect of this Bill?",
      "Barry Hughes : Can I give you an example, which might illustrate the way in which things could be different? This is one, which\u2014I give credit to Iwan for this, because he thought of it. If we take an adult with a small child\u2014say, a four-year-old\u2014in a supermarket, and the child is pulling cans off the shelves, it's quite annoying, and they keep doing it and keep doing it. The parent remonstrates, and the parent ends up finding that verbal admonishment is inadequate, and smacks the child lightly on the legs, which does the trick and the child stops. Presently, if someone in that supermarket were to report that to the police, I think the police would probably conclude that that is covered by the defence of reasonable chastisement. In other words, the evidential stage wouldn't be passed; you don't get on to consider the public interest. But if we have that same parent in there the following week, and you have the same happen again, presently, the defence would apply. Now, there comes a point in time when the defence stops applying. If that defence didn't apply at all, and we had a sequence of three offences, the public interest test would kick in, if I may put it like that, pretty quickly, because it would be repeated behaviour. So, that would be the distinction between how things are now and how they would be in the future, because the defence would not be available, so the public interest test would then come to the fore that much more quickly. So, when we apply the public interest test, the essence of it is about proportionality, and trying to come up with an approach that is proportionate to the offending. We look at the age of the offender, the age of the victim, we look at the circumstances, we look at the impact upon the victim, we look at the impact that's likely in relation to the suspect, and there is, within the code, a long list of matters that we take into account. Some of them are fairly obvious, such as previous convictions. If someone's got previous convictions for doing something wrong, it's more likely they're going to be prosecuted the next time. But there's no part of the law that says that prosecution will always follow. Mostly, it's reasonably obvious; the more serious an offence, the more likely you are to be prosecuted.",
      "Vikki Howells AM : Thank you, that's really useful, and\u2014",
      "Lynne Neagle AM : Just before you move on, can I ask you a question? This morning the committee was meeting with groups of parents who are opposed to the Bill and groups of parents who are for the Bill, and one of the parents this morning was querying where the interests of the child would come into the public interest test. Now, I've looked at the code and there is a section about impact on the victim. Can you just clarify for the record how the best interests of the child would be taken into account in considering whether to go forward with a prosecution?",
      "Barry Hughes : Normally, if there were an assault by someone else upon a child, outside the family, we would tend to take views from the parents of that child. In circumstances where both parents, arguably, are the suspects, we probably wouldn't be asking them. We would find another way, and we would talk with the police to ensure that we are informed about how the child feels about what has happened. It may be that there are\u2014. I can foresee real difficulties in circumstances where we have parents who are separating where the children are being used, effectively, in divorce proceedings, for example, where we might have one parent saying there was a really bad impact upon the child and the other parent saying there wasn't. We'd want to find a way to cut through that to work out really from the police how does the child feel about that. So, we would tailor it to the circumstances of the particular incident to assess how the child feels about it. It's not determinative, nor is it determinative in cases where we prosecute for adult defendants inflicting some form of assault upon adult victims. It's not determinative but it is a factor that we take into account.",
      "Lynne Neagle AM : Okay, thank you. Suzy, you've got a supplementary on that.",
      "Suzy Davies AM : Yes. In the same session this morning I thought this was an interesting question raised by a parent, on the rights of the child side of things, where if a parent offers a child two forms of punishment because that child has done something that they know they shouldn't have, and they're given the option of, 'You can have a quick smack and a cwtch, or you're going to your bedroom for quarter of an hour', and the child is allowed to choose and the child chooses the smack, what happens then? I'm not offering any views on the fact that this choice has been given, but it was put to us today about how would that fall in the law once it were changed.",
      "Barry Hughes : That's a really interesting question. There is a body of law that\u2014",
      "Suzy Davies AM : A child can't consent to assault.",
      "Barry Hughes : Yes, you can't consent to a serious assault, apart from in certain\u2014. The law is really quite difficult. So, for example, tattooing is a serious assault on one level, but you can consent to a tattoo. I can think of one case where a man branded his initials on a woman's buttocks, but she consented to it and the Court of Appeal held that they could consent to that. I can also think of a series of cases, which I won't get into here, that involve sadomasochistic behaviour between adults, some of which was really serious, and involved people willingly applying themselves to things that no sane person would do. And the Court of Appeal in that case, a case called Brown, said, 'No, that's going too far\u2014you can't consent to that.' Then, you may have seen there was a case from the midlands recently where a gentleman operating a tattoo parlour was also involved in body surgery\u2014splitting people's tongues. That went too far as well. So, there is again\u2014I referred before to the spectrum of offending, and there is a clear spectrum of offending that you can realistically consent to and then you get to offending you can't consent to. So, the law has considered that in some depth. I'm still not entirely clear, and I speak as a lawyer. When it comes to much lesser assaults, the law is more unclear as to what you can consent to.",
      "Suzy Davies AM : Yes, because we're talking below a certain standard here as well. Okay.",
      "Barry Hughes : As to what you can consent to, it's less clear. It would need to be developed.",

We distributed some more enquetes , questionnaires . And um besides that um I deployed some trend-watchers to Milan and Paris to well get all of the newest trends . And I've consulted some additional trend-watch trend-watchers , after the original trend-watchers return , about what the the best design would be . Um okay these are some overall findings . Um most important thing is the fancy design . Um the research indicated that that was by far the most important factor . Um innovativeness was about half as important as the fancy design . By innovativeness this means um functions which are not featured in other remote controls . Um about half of , half as important as the innovativeness was the was easy to use . Um for our um group , we're focusing on the people of sixty to eighty y years old , this is um , these factors are slightly more equal . 'Kay these are some more group specific findings . Uh the older people prefer dark colours . Uh they like recognisable shapes , and familiar material . And our surveys have indicated that especially wood is pretty much the material for older people . Um this is , this image will give you a little bit of an impression about um the look-and-feel that um the remote should have . Um this leads us to some personal preferences . Uh the remote control and the docking station should uh blend in in the in the room . Um so this would mean no uh eye-catching designs . Just keep it simple and {disfmarker} Well the docking station and small screen would be our main points of interest , because this would be the {disfmarker} These would uh be the innovativeness in the remote control . So this would be very important that we {vocalsound} at least include these features . Um well the trend-watchers I consulted advised that it b should be , the remote control and the docking station should be telephone-shaped . So you could imagine that uh the remote control will be standing up straight in the docking station . This is not really {disfmarker} This is pretty much a new shape to uh older people . So they would prefer uh a design where the remote control just lies flat in the docking station . So it would be kinda more telephone-shaped . Um besides that we would advise um to bring two editions , one with a wood-like colour and maybe feel , and one with a grey-black colour . The wood-like for the more uh exclusive people . People with more money . Uh the grey-black colour for well people with less means . That would be all .",

Um uh let's see . Um yeah and {disfmarker} Uh {gap} we uh need some uh new a attractive functions uh uh which attract uh uh people for using it . So uh it's uh like a speak uh speech uh recognition and um a special button for selecting uh subtitles . Just uh what we uh mentioned uh last uh meeting . Um and yeah overall um user-friendly .

Uh one push on the button uh you get uh uh small uh subtitles . Um double push push um , if double click , um so uh you get uh big uh subtitles , for uh people uh um uh which c f uh who can't uh read small uh subtitles .

Um also we want to uh use a little d display uh for um for displaying the uh the functions of the buttons .

Uh for the b buttons , we can use plastic or rubber . And the chip-set , um it says simple here , but it should be advanced , because we're using an L_C_D_ uh screen . And as uh the trend-watcher presentation showed , um people like wood , but it raises the price and it doesn't really fit the image , unless we would start two product lines . Form should follow function overall . Um well the kinetic energy source is rather fancy . But depends on what we want . I think we should disc discuss that .

      "Grad C : Um . Well , I 've been reading some literature about clustering of data . Just , um , I guess , let me put it in context . OK , so we 're talking about discovering intermediate categories to , um {disfmarker} to classify . And , uh , I was looking at some of the work that , uh , Sangita was doing on these TRAPS things . So she has , um {disfmarker} she has temporal patterns for , um , a certain set of phonemes , from {disfmarker} from TIMIT , right ? the most common phonemes . And each one of them has {disfmarker} has a {disfmarker} a nice pattern over time , a one {disfmarker} one second window . And it has {disfmarker} has these patterns . Um , so she has , um a TRAP for each one of the phonemes , um , times fifteen , for each of the fifteen critical bands . And , um , {vocalsound} she does this agglomerative hierarchical clustering which {disfmarker} which basically , um , is a clustering algorithm that , uh , starts with many , many , many different points {disfmarker} many different clusters {disfmarker} uh , corresponding to the number of data , uh , patterns that you have in the data . And then you have this distance mej metric which , uh , measures how {disfmarker} how closely related they are . And you start , um {vocalsound} by merging the patterns that are most closely related .",
      "PhD E : And you create a tree .",
      "Grad C : And y yeah , yeah , a dendrogram tree .",
      "PhD E : Mm - hmm .",
      "Grad C : Um .",
      "PhD E : And then you can pick , uh , values anywhere along that tree to fix your set of clusters .",
      "Grad C : Right , usually it 's when , um {disfmarker} when the sol similarity measures , um , don't go down as much .",
      "PhD E : Mm - hmm .",
      "Grad C : And so , uh {disfmarker} so you stop at that point . And what she found was , sh um , was there were five broad , um {disfmarker} broad categories , uh , corresponding to , uh , things like , uh , fricatives and , uh , vocalic , um , and , uh , stops .",
      "Professor B : Mm - hmm .",
      "Grad C : And , uh , one for silence and {disfmarker} and another one for schwa {disfmarker} schwa sounds . Um , and , um , I was thinking about ways to {disfmarker} to generalize this because w you 're {disfmarker} it 's sort of like a {disfmarker} it 's not a completely automatic way of clustering , because yo beforehand you have these {disfmarker} these TRAPS and you 're saying that {disfmarker} that these frames correspond to this particular phoneme . Um , and that 's {disfmarker} that 's constraining your {disfmarker} your clustering to {disfmarker} to the set of phonemes that you already have . Um , whereas maybe we want to just take {disfmarker} take a look at , um , arbitrary windows in time , um , of varying length , um , and cluster those .",
      "PhD E : Mm - hmm .",
      "Grad C : And I 'm thinking if we {disfmarker} if we do that , then we would probably , um , at some point in the clustering algorithm find that we 've clustered things like , OK , thi this is a transition , um , this is a relatively stable {disfmarker} stable point .",
      "PhD E : Mm - hmm .",
      "Grad C : Um , and I 'm hoping to find other things of {disfmarker} of similarity and maybe use these things as the intermediate , um {disfmarker} intermediate categories that , uh , um , I 'll later classify .",
      "PhD E : Mm - hmm .",
      "Professor B : Are you looking at these in narrow bands ?",
      "Grad C : Um , right . F um , I 'm {disfmarker}",
      "Professor B : Cuz that 's what you 're gonna be using , right ?",
      "Grad C : Yeah , yeah . I {disfmarker} I haven't exactly figured out , um , the exact details for that but , uh , the {disfmarker} the representation of the data that I was thinking of , was using , um , critical band , um , energies , {vocalsound} um , over different lengths of time . So {disfmarker} Yeah .",
      "Professor B : Yeah , I mean , it seems somehow that needs th uh , there 's a couple things that I wonder about with this . I mean , so one is {disfmarker} is , {pause} again , looking at the same representation ,",
      "Grad C : OK .",
      "Professor B : I mean , if you 're going for this sort of thing where you have {pause} uh , little detectors that are looking at narrow bands , then what you 're going to be looking for should be some category that you can find with the narrow bands .",
      "Grad C : Mm - hmm .",
      "Professor B : That {disfmarker} that seems to be kind of fundamental to it . Um , and then the other thing , uh , is {disfmarker} that I wonder about with it , and {disfmarker} and don't take this in the wrong way , like I {disfmarker} I know what I 'm doing or anything ,",
      "Grad C : Right .",
      "Professor B : but , I mean . {vocalsound} Um , just wondering really .",
      "Grad C : Mm - hmm .",
      "Professor B : Um , the sort of standard answer about this sort of thing is that if you 're trying to find {pause} the right system in some sense , whether you 're trying by categories or {disfmarker} or parameters {pause} um , and your goal is discrimination , then having choices based on discrimination as opposed to , um , unsupervised nearness of things , um , is actually better .",
      "Grad C : Hmm .",
      "Professor B : Um , and I don't know if that {disfmarker} I mean , since you 're dealing with issues of robustness , you know , maybe {disfmarker} maybe this isn't right , but it 'd be something I 'd be concerned about . Because , for instance , you can imagine , uh , uh , i i if you remember from {disfmarker} from , uh {disfmarker} from your {disfmarker} your quals , John Ohala saying that , uh , \" buh \" {comment} and \" puh \" {comment} differed , uh , not really cuz of voicing but because of aspiration . I mean , in as far as wha what 's really there in the acoustics .",
      "Grad C : Mm - hmm .",
      "Professor B : So , um , if you looked {disfmarker} if you were doing some coarse clustering , you probably would put those two sounds together . And yet , I would gue I would guess that many of your recognition errors were coming from , uh , um , pfft , {comment} screwing up on this distinction .",
      "Grad C : Mm - hmm .",
      "Professor B : So , in fact , it 's a little hard because recognizers , to first order , sort of work . And the reasons we 're doing the things we 're doing is because they don't work as well as we 'd like . And since they sort of work , uh , it means that they are already doing {disfmarker} if you go and take any recognizer that 's already out there and you say , \" how well is it distinguishing between {pause} schwas and stops ? \"",
      "Grad C : Mm - hmm .",
      "Professor B : Boy , I bet they 're all doing nearly perfectly on this , right ?",
      "Grad C : Mm - hmm .",
      "Professor B : So these {disfmarker} these big categories that differ in huge obvious ways , we already know how to do . So , what are we bringing to the party ? I mean , in fact what we wanna do is have something that , particularly in the presence of noise , uh , is better at distinguishing between , uh , categories that are actually close to one another , and hence , would probably be clustered together .",
      "Grad C : Mmm .",
      "Professor B : So that 's th that 's the hard thing . I mean , I understand that there 's this other constraint that you 're considering , is that you wanna have categories that , uh {disfmarker} that would be straightforward for , say , a human being to mark if you had manual annotation . And it 's something that you really think you can pick up . But I think it 's also essential that you wanna look at what are the {vocalsound} confusions that you 're making and how can you come up with , uh , categories that , uh , can clarify these confusions .",
      "Grad C : Mm - hmm . Hmm .",
      "Professor B : So , I mean , the standard sort of way of doing that is take a look at the algorithms you 're looking at , but then throw in some discriminative aspect to it .  Y y this is more like , you know , how does LDA differ from PCA ? I mean , they 're the same sort of thing . They 're both orthogonalizing .",
      "Grad C : Right .",
      "Professor B : But , you know {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and , um , this is a little harder because you 're not just trying to find parameters . You 're actually trying to find the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the categories themselves . Uh , so a little more like brain surgery , I think on yourself . Uh . So , uh",
      "Grad C : Yeah .",
      "Professor B : Um , anyway . That 's my {pause} thought .",
      "Grad C : OK .",
      "Professor B : You 've been thinking about this problem for a long time actually . I mean , well {disfmarker} W actually , you stopped thinking about it for a long time , but you used to think about it {vocalsound} a lot .",
      "PhD E : Yeah .",
      "Professor B : And you 've been thinking about it more now ,",
      "PhD D : Yeah .",
      "Professor B : these categories .",
      "PhD E : Yeah .",
      "Professor B : Mm - hmm .",
      "PhD E : I guess {disfmarker} I don't {disfmarker} I don't {disfmarker} um , it 's not clear to me how to reconcile , you know , what you 're saying , which I think is right , with {pause} the way I 've been looking at it . That it 's {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} it 's all not very clear to me . But it seems to me that the desire {disfmarker} the desirable feature to have is something that , um , is bottom - up . You know , however we do that .",
      "Professor B : Mm - hmm .",
      "PhD E : And and so I guess what I don't understand is how to do that and still be discriminative , because to be discriminative you have to have categories and the only categories that we know of to use are sort of these human {disfmarker} human sig significant {disfmarker} categories that are significant to humans , like phonemes , things like that .",
      "Professor B : Right .",
      "PhD E : But that 's sort of what you want to avoid . And so that feels {disfmarker} I don't know how to get out of this .",
      "Professor B : Well , here 's a {disfmarker} here 's a , uh , uh Here 's a generic and possibly useless thought , which is , {vocalsound} um , what do you really {disfmarker} I mean , in a sense the only s s systems that make sense , uh , are ones that {disfmarker} that have something from top - down in th in them . Right ? Because if e even the smallest organism that 's trying to learn to do anything , if it doesn't have any kind of reward for doing {disfmarker} or penal penalty for doing anything , then it 's just going to behave randomly .",
      "PhD E : Mm - hmm .",
      "Professor B : So whether you 're talking about something being learned through evolution or being learned through experience , it 's gotta have something come down to it that gives its reward or , you know , at least some reinforcement learning ,",
      "PhD E : Right .",
      "Professor B : right ?",
      "PhD E : So the question is , how far down ?",
      "Professor B : And",
      "PhD E : We could stop at words , but we don't , right ? We go all the way down to phonemes .",
      "Professor B : Right , but I me I {disfmarker} I think that maybe in some ways part of the difficulty is {disfmarker} is trying to deal with the {disfmarker} with these phonemes . You know , and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and i it 's almost like you want categories if {disfmarker} if our {disfmarker} if our , uh , um , {vocalsound} metric of {disfmarker} of goodness , uh , i if our {disfmarker}",
      "PhD E : Mm - hmm .",
      "Professor B : correction {disfmarker} if our metric of badness {vocalsound} is word error rate then , um , maybe we should be looking at words .",
      "PhD E : Mm - hmm .",
      "Professor B : I mean , for {disfmarker} for {disfmarker} for very nice , uh , reasons we 've looked for a while at syllables , and they have a lot of good properties , but i i i if you go all the way to words , I mean , that 's really {disfmarker} I mean , d w In many applications you wanna go further . You wanna go to concepts or something , or have {disfmarker} have {disfmarker} have concepts , actions , this sort of thing .",
      "PhD E : Yeah . But words would be a nice {disfmarker}",
      "Professor B : But , words aren't bad , yeah . And {disfmarker} and",
      "PhD E : Yeah , so the common {disfmarker} right , the common wisdom is you can't do words because there 's too many of them , right ? So you have to have some smaller set that you can use , uh , and {disfmarker} and so everybody goes to phonemes . But the problem is that we {disfmarker} we build models of words in terms of phonemes and these models are {disfmarker} are really cartoon - ish , right ? So when you look at conversational speech , for example , you don't see the phonemes that you {disfmarker} that you have in your word models .",
      "Professor B : Yeah . But {disfmarker} but {disfmarker} but we 're not trying for models of words here . See , so her here 's maybe where {disfmarker} If the issue is that we 're trying to come up with , um , some sort of intermediate categories which will then be useful for later stuff , uh , then {pause} maybe it doesn't matter that we can't have enough {disfmarker}",
      "PhD E : Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .",
      "Professor B : I mean , what you wanna do is {disfmarker} is build up these categories that are {disfmarker} that are best for word recognition .",
      "PhD E : Right . Right .",
      "Professor B : And {disfmarker} and somehow if that 's built into the loop of what the categories {disfmarker} I mean , we do this every day in this very gross way of {disfmarker} of running o a thousand experiments",
      "PhD E :  Right .",
      "Professor B : because we have fast computers and picking the thing that has the best word error rate .",
      "PhD E : Yeah .",
      "Professor B : In some way {disfmarker} I mean , we derive that all the time . In some ways it 's really not {comment} a bad {disfmarker} bad thing to do because it tells you in fact how your adjustments at the very low level affect the {disfmarker} the final goal .",
      "PhD E : Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .",
      "Professor B : Um , so maybe there 's a way to even put that in in a much more automatic way ,",
      "PhD E : Right .",
      "Professor B : where you take , you know , something about the error at the level of the word or some other {disfmarker} it could be syllable {disfmarker} but in some large unit ,",
      "PhD E : Uh - huh .",
      "Professor B : uh , and uh {disfmarker} yeah , you may not have word models , you have phone models , whatever , but you sort of {pause} don't worry about that , and just somehow feed it back through .",
      "PhD E : Mm - hmm .",
      "Professor B : You know , so that 's , uh , wh what I called a useless comments because I 'm not really telling you how to do it . But I mean , it 's a {disfmarker} {vocalsound} it 's {disfmarker} it 's , you know {disfmarker} it",
      "PhD E : No , but I think the important part in there is that , you know , if you want to be discriminative , you have to have uh , you know , categories .",
      "Professor B : Right .",
      "PhD E : And I think this {disfmarker} the important categories are the words , and {pause} not the phones .",
      "Professor B : Yeah . Yeah .",
      "PhD E : Maybe . And so {disfmarker} Right . If you can put the words in to the loop somehow for determining goodness of your sets of clusters {disfmarker} Uh {disfmarker}",
      "Professor B : Now , that being said , I think that {disfmarker} that if you have something that is , um {disfmarker} i Once you start dealing with spontaneous speech , all the things you 're saying are {disfmarker} are really true .",
      "PhD E : Mm - hmm .",
      "Professor B : If you {pause} have read speech that 's been manually annotated , like TIMIT , then , you know , i i you the phones are gonna be right , actually , {vocalsound} for the most part .",
      "PhD E : Yeah . Yeah ,",
      "Professor B : So {disfmarker} so , uh , it doesn't really hurt them to {disfmarker} to do that , to put in discrimination at that level .",
      "PhD E : yeah .",
      "Professor B : Um , if you go to spontaneous speech then it 's {disfmarker} it 's trickier and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and , uh , the phones are {disfmarker} uh , you know , it 's gonna be based on bad pronunciation models that you have of {disfmarker}",
      "PhD E :",
      "Professor B : and , um {disfmarker} And it won't allow for the overlapping phenomenon",
      "PhD E : Mmm . So it 's almost like there 's this mechanism that we have that , you know , when {disfmarker} when we 're hearing read speech and all the phonemes are there you know , we {disfmarker} we deal with that , but {disfmarker} but when we go to conversational , and then all of a sudden not all the phonemes are there , it doesn't really matter that much to us as humans because we have some kind of mechanism that allows for these word models , whatever those models are , to be {pause} munged , you know , and {disfmarker} and it doesn't really hurt , and I 'm not sure how {disfmarker} {vocalsound} how to build that in . Uh .",
      "Professor B : Yeah , I mean , I guess the other thing i is {disfmarker} is to think of a little bit {disfmarker} I mean , we when y when you start looking at these kind of results I think it usually is {disfmarker} is pretty intuitive , but start looking at um , what are the kinds of confusions that you do make , uh , you know , between words if you want or {disfmarker} or {disfmarker} or , uh , even phones in {disfmarker} in {disfmarker} in {disfmarker} in read speech , say , uh , when there is noise .

      "Grad C : Mm - hmm .",

And if that {disfmarker} if that is {disfmarker} if it {disfmarker} uh , if that turns it into another word or {disfmarker} or different {disfmarker} you know , or another pair of words or something , then it 's more likely to happen .

Took hundred people and covered all the aspects of what um is needed by people and what they want to see . Um {vocalsound} everything kinda from functionality and how individual functions are {disfmarker} how mu how how often they're used and how much their necessary and stuff . And general opinions about current current remotes . See that , as we kinda noticed , seventy five percent of people find their remote controls ugly . So some kind of a new style should be incorporated that's less ugly {vocalsound} . Uh along with um looking less ugly , if it looks better , eighty percent of people said they'd spend more money on it . Which is a a plus for us , if we can make it look better , it'd be uh more cost effective and we can put the price up . Current remote controls do not match the operating behaviour of the user . I can empl I kinda take that to mean as um {vocalsound} they they don't uh {disfmarker} they , yeah , they only use {disfmarker} they only work for the television or yeah like as in in my flat I've got six remote controls for a stereo system , a digital box , a D_V_D_ player , a video player and T_V_ . If it was uh {disfmarker} I mean th my behaviour is to use multiple things at the same time and multiple remotes aren't really matched well to my behaviour . {vocalsound} Uh again , seventy five percent is {disfmarker} seventy five percent of users say they zap a lot . I took to mean that they just {disfmarker} they use it a lot , they use it regularly rather than standing up and manually change channels or volume {gap} . {vocalsound} And uh yeah , uh I think the big issue is fifty percent users only use ten percent of the buttons , 'cause uh wh if we got a remote that like {disfmarker} well we'll have some buttons taken off by the lack of teletext , but uh oh and we're going to see uh on the {disfmarker} uh that some of the functions like audio settings aren't h hardly ever used and used very {disfmarker} aren't considered relevant by the user .

      "Project Manager : Mm-hmm .",
      "User Interface : and probably this is one that people complain about , about having too many buttons that you don't use . So basically , what a remote control is is you {disfmarker} it's to send messages to the television set , you know , turn on , off , switch the channels and the volume and things such as that . And so for this product it's gonna be television only , and then it has to have the uh logos for the company and the colours . And so , for my personal preferences , I think this one is easier to use and has quite a {disfmarker} you know , fewer buttons . Um we want something that sends messages easily to the television and I was kind of wondering about this example that they have . It looks kind of narrow at the top , and I was thinking maybe if it were wider at the top ,",
      "Project Manager : Mm , yeah .",
      "User Interface : then that would be easier . Um {vocalsound} and so we have to decide what's gonna make our product different . E the unique style , maybe have it light up so it's visible in the dark , um the changeable face-plates , and the lighting up and visible I was {disfmarker} when we were talking about havi losing it , maybe to have a button on the television that you press and it {disfmarker} maybe if it makes a noise or lights up or something like that , so it's easier to find if someone has hidden under the couch or something like that .

      "Janet Finch-Saunders AM : And finally from me, what specific steps have been put in place to take forward the commitments from the Welsh Government's 2017 childcare/play early years workforce plan to build a better understanding of the workforce's Welsh language skills to enable support for the sector to be targeted and to identify where capacity needs to be built for the future to meet the needs of the early years sector in a bilingual Wales?",
      "Julie Morgan AM : We think this is very important, and we're pleased that 29 per cent of children taking up the childcare offer are in Welsh or bilingual settings, so we think that's very good. We have established a specific programme to develop Welsh language skills in the childcare and play workforce with the National Centre for Learning Welsh, to develop workplace Welsh language skills across the sector. So, we're actually working with that, and I think you've done something with those recently, haven't you? I don't know if you want to\u2014",
      "Nicola Edwards : Yes. So, we have a stakeholder group where we've brought together a variety of people with an interest in the early years, childcare and play sectors, and we had a presentation just last month from the national language centre about the education programmes that they're rolling out, and how this is all coming together, which is quite interesting. We've been working quite carefully to make sure that the variety of work-based learning programmes that we provide and offer are also available in Welsh and bilingually. Recruitment and retention within the childcare and play sector is quite challenging in any\u00a0 case. Recruiting and retaining staff with really good Welsh language skills adds an extra dimension to it, and\u00a0that it's a point that Mudiad Meithrin makes to us quite regularly, that they do struggle to find staff with the right skills. So, upskilling the existing workforce is a key part of it, but also doing more to attract people in with Welsh language skills in the first place in terms of the training courses that we're taking forward, and thinking about that in the context of the targets within Cymraeg 2050 and the aim to get to one million Welsh speakers. So, as the Deputy Minister said, we've got quite a number of children accessing the offer in Welsh-medium or bilingual settings at the moment. We're going to be doing some baselining work against that in terms of local authorities' Welsh in education strategic plans and education places, and what we can then do to increase the number of childcare places in parallel with that so that you can make sure that you start that pathway through learning Welsh, interacting with education and childcare through Welsh at a much earlier stage.",
      "Lynne Neagle AM : Suzy, you've got a supplementary.",
      "Suzy Davies AM : Just on this early point, anybody who's been through the Welsh education system, which is 20 years now, will have some Welsh language skills, obviously to differing degrees. For the entrants that are coming into childcare training now, there are going to be very few of them, realistically, with no Welsh at all, so what's actually being incorporated into the early years care training to make sure, at that stage, that the Welsh language skills are being developed, as opposed to an add-on later on?",
      "Nicola Edwards : You're quite right. Most people coming through the education system will have some awareness of Welsh although I think it's probably important to remember we do also employ people from outside of wales.",
      "Suzy Davies AM : Yes, but the majority, being realistic.",
      "Nicola Edwards : But they don't necessarily have Welsh that is appropriate. They've got Welsh that they've developed in school. It's not necessarily appropriate for then teaching that language to children, who may be coming from families who don't use Welsh at home. So, that might be the first interaction that child has with the language. So, there's a lot of that in terms of child development and how you develop children bilingually, particularly if they're coming from English-medium homes, and reinforcing the language in language choices. There will also be some people who are, perhaps\u2014we see this quite a lot in the office\u2014quite confident in terms of speaking Welsh but less so in terms of some of the paperwork, the reporting, the writing and the interacting with parents more officially, which we need to think about as well. But it is mainly about getting people to a point where they can transmit that language onwards in a confident and meaningful way.",
      "Suzy Davies AM : Okay. And it's ingrained in the early years training.",
      "Nicola Edwards : Yes.",
      "Suzy Davies AM : Okay. That's fine. Thank you for that. Thank you, Chair.",
      "Lynne Neagle AM : Just before we move on, you said that 29 per cent of the take-up of the childcare offer is either through Welsh or is bilingual. Have you got any figures about how many children are accessing it in Welsh only?",
      "Nicola Edwards : We will have. It becomes\u2014. With the way we do it, it's because of the way that the setting defines their language category, and that's how we collect it. We do go down to individual child level, although it's anonymised, data collection on a termly basis. So I'll have a look and see if we can send you through the last term.",
      "Lynne Neagle AM : Maybe if the committee could have a note, that would be really useful.",
      "Nicola Edwards : Yes, that's fine.",
      "Lynne Neagle AM : We've got some questions now on childcare from Dawn Bowden.",
      "Dawn Bowden AM : Thank you, Chair. Deputy Minister, the evaluation of the childcare offer, when it was published last year, said that there was very little evidence currently available to determine what its impact was. You're going to be producing a second evaluation in November this year; do you expect to see some indications now of the impact?",
      "Julie Morgan AM : Well, the evaluation of the first year of the childcare offer was very limited, because the childcare offer wasn't available throughout the whole of Wales. And it was a very early implementation phase. So, obviously it takes time to grow. And the evaluation for year 2, I think, will also show a limited impact for the same reasons. The offer became available across the whole of Wales only last April. So we've only got since last April that it's actually been fully available. And the parental survey was released to parents in June 2019, therefore any impact on parents in the authorities coming on board in the second year will also be negligible. So, it's from the next one, however, we hope that we will get more information.",
      "Dawn Bowden AM : So you think, by the time we get to November 2020, you might have a better picture.",
      "Julie Morgan AM : The evaluation will be more meaningful, we think, then, yes."

      "Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Makes sense .",
      "Industrial Designer : Okay",
      "Marketing : Okay . Right um , I have a little thing . So , we've all got a note of {disfmarker} it's thirteen point seven , isn't it , with everything we want on .",
      "Project Manager : {gap} . Sorry , do you want that back up ?",
      "Marketing : Yeah , I just had a presentation to do . {vocalsound}",
      "Project Manager : Right .",
      "User Interface : But I do think uh the v uh voice recognition thing would be more impressive than the fact that it's got no battery .",
      "Project Manager : Okay , but remember the main {disfmarker} the only reason we were planning on having the voice recognition was so that they could find the remote if it got lost .",
      "Marketing : Mm-hmm . Mm . {vocalsound} Right okay um , This is about the evaluation criteria that we use for the the prototype we've got here .",
      "User Interface : {vocalsound}",
      "Marketing : And so the method is that the design team makes a prototype , and we evaluate the prototype against some criteria that we've formulated . And those ones are gonna be in response to sort of market research , and also finance , I guess . {vocalsound} And do that on a scale from say true being one and false being seven , so if it's neither true nor false , then that's four . So , I got a set of criteria just based on the marketing that we need to add in a financial one as well , at the end . Um so , We have to say whether it's true or false that the product looks and feels fancy . Um {disfmarker} The {disfmarker} whether the product demonstrates technical innovation . Whether it's easy to use . Whether it's incorporating sort of the fashion element to attract the buyer . And whether it's a sort of recognisable Real Reaction product . And I have to go up onto the whiteboard and do this apparently ,",
      "Industrial Designer : Okay .",
      "Marketing : so {vocalsound} I'll go over here . {vocalsound} Right . So the first one is um , does the product look and feel fancy . So if we do a sort of a one {disfmarker} So {disfmarker}",
      "Industrial Designer : Okay , well we have a single curve , which was {gap} maybe like the feel of the product's quite good .",
      "Marketing : Yeah .",
      "Industrial Designer : So uh {disfmarker}",
      "Marketing : Okay .",
      "Industrial Designer : Um , then we have the rubber kinda spongy feel , which was in at the time .",
      "Marketing : Yeah . Yeah . Yeah .",
      "Industrial Designer : Um , {vocalsound} sorry that'd be considered fancy .",
      "User Interface : Yeah , I'd maybe give it a a two .",
      "Marketing : {vocalsound} Of {disfmarker} but I think {disfmarker} What {disfmarker} Is one false , or is t one true ?",
      "User Interface : One's true .",
      "Marketing : I forgot . One's true , and okay . Seven's fal",
      "User Interface : And a four is neutral .",
      "Marketing : Four is neutral , okay . So {disfmarker}",
      "Industrial Designer : So maybe {gap} maybe a two .",
      "User Interface : Yeah , 'cause we haven't got the double curve , so we can't like say it's completely true .",
      "Project Manager : {vocalsound} Go for one . {vocalsound} Yep .",
      "Marketing : Right .",
      "User Interface : {vocalsound} But it's pretty close . We've got almost everything we can .",
      "Marketing : Okay . Right .",
      "Project Manager : Okay .",
      "Marketing : I gonna put underneath so I've got some more space . So , false is seven , true is one , and {disfmarker} So uh say about a two for fancy ,",
      "Industrial Designer : Yeah .",
      "User Interface : Yeah .",
      "Marketing : you think ?",
      "Project Manager : Yeah , why not not ,",
      "Marketing : Okay .",
      "Project Manager : m m maybe nearer three .",
      "Marketing : Okay , well d you do an average at the end , I don't know . Um {disfmarker}",
      "Project Manager : Two three . Well , it's just that uh saying something {disfmarker} {vocalsound} remember that when you look down , we've got solar power , we've got uh various other things you could have , and we're not going for these options .",
      "Marketing : Uh-huh . This this is just this is just for like the look . Does it sort of look fancy rather than functional . So {disfmarker}",
      "Project Manager : Mm-hmm . {vocalsound}",
      "User Interface : Yeah , I suppose that might be in the technical innovation bit .",
      "Marketing : Yeah , so that {disfmarker} so sh should we go for a a two on that ?",
      "Project Manager : Okay .",
      "Marketing : 'Kay . And I mean , how much does the product demonstrate technical innovation do you reckon ?",
      "Industrial Designer : Um , {gap} deciding between the kinetic power or um the speech recognition , and if we had either of those for our budget , they both show a reasonable amount of speech recognition .",
      "Marketing : D yeah . Okay . So , what about the pr The prototype as it is ,",
      "Industrial Designer : Um {disfmarker}",
      "Marketing : we've got we've got the speech recognition on it , haven't we .",
      "Industrial Designer : But not the kinetic .",
      "Marketing : But not the kinetic .",
      "Industrial Designer : Like the power .",
      "Project Manager : No . 'Cause you can't afford that {disfmarker} w we took that out too .",
      "Industrial Designer : No , we c ca yeah , we can't afford both .",
      "Marketing : Alright , so {disfmarker}",
      "Project Manager : Didn't you ? Or {disfmarker}",
      "Marketing : So it doesn't {disfmarker} It's pretty {disfmarker} The prototype as it is isn't sort of um fulfilling the {disfmarker}",
      "Industrial Designer : No may is {disfmarker} maybe about neutral",
      "User Interface : Maybe a three .",
      "Industrial Designer : plus it it it's got something , but it hasn't got {disfmarker}",
      "Marketing : {vocalsound} Okay . Yeah .",
      "Project Manager : Well , wait a minute . In thirteen point seven we do have kinetic .",
      "User Interface : I would give it more than a four .",
      "Project Manager : The problem is we have to reduce down from there to get it down to twelve point five .",
      "Industrial Designer : Right .",
      "Project Manager : And one way of doing that would be to take out the kinetic .",
      "Industrial Designer : Okay .",
      "Project Manager : So , it's very much dependant on what you do with your options . And if you're definitely going for the sample sensor and sample speaker , then {disfmarker} because that {vocalsound}",
      "Industrial Designer : 'Kay .",
      "Marketing : Right , okay .",
      "Project Manager : the other functions we've got in are are more at the {vocalsound} {disfmarker} The special material , the rubber , wood , titanium , et cetera , if you go for that , th that's at the high end 'cause that's point six , whereas down at uh just special colours uh is point two . Now you're trying to lose one point two , so it seems to me that if you're going for the sample sensors {disfmarker} speaker , you're basically then having to go for the cheaper options on everything else .",
      "Marketing : Mm-hmm .",
      "Industrial Designer : Okay .",
      "Project Manager : And and the simple way to do it would be to have a battery , to have your uh sample sensor speaker ,",
      "Industrial Designer : Um {disfmarker}",
      "Project Manager : and then you're looking to uh take out uh point two ,",
      "Marketing : S I'm just gonna check my email . {vocalsound}",
      "Project Manager : which would be {disfmarker} come from the button supplements category .",
      "Marketing : I'm just gonna check exactly what it said in the email for um the product .",
      "User Interface : How much of a difference would it make if we made the case in plastic ? Because we did say that we don't wanna follow the fashion too much . If the buttons are rubber that might be spongy enough .",
      "Project Manager : Um , interface type um ,",
      "User Interface : And then it stand the test of time better .",
      "Project Manager : well plastic rather than rubber . {vocalsound}",
      "Marketing : Okay . But I {disfmarker}",
      "Project Manager : That that that would make the significant difference . You could either {vocalsound} you could have it {disfmarker} If you have a in plastic rather than rubber , then that would uh enable you to get {disfmarker} you could keep kinetic then , you could keep your sample sensor , and you'd be looking to take out point two . So you could uh fiddle that down your special form at the bottom , or your special colour at the bottom .",
      "Industrial Designer : Mm-hmm .",
      "Project Manager : And that would enable you to to do it .",
      "User Interface : Mm-hmm .",
      "Marketing : Okay .",
      "Industrial Designer : So it says if we make a slightly more fancy , then we lose points innovation , and if we make it more innovative innovative , then we lose points on it being fancy , so {disfmarker}",
      "Project Manager : Yeah .",
      "Marketing : Yeah .",
      "Project Manager : Ye",
      "Marketing : {vocalsound} {gap} , I just read the email again and it sort of says it's evaluate the design sort of as it is , I think , so I think we need to think about finance after we've sort of evaluated that design . I don't know whether we're doing it in the wrong order or something or .",
      "Project Manager : Well , okay , but {disfmarker}",
      "User Interface : Well , I suppose it's rubber as it is , isn't it .",
      "Project Manager : It's rubber as it is , yes .",
      "Marketing : So , I mean does this need to go up a bit or something , 'cause we've got both the both the um the speech {disfmarker}",
      "Project Manager : We got {disfmarker} we've we've got thirteen point seven",
      "User Interface : Yeah .",
      "Project Manager : and we've got it in at the moment and if {disfmarker} and basically , we're going to reduce down from that .",
      "Marketing : Yeah .",
      "Project Manager : But the current one , you'd say would be fancy , would be too {disfmarker} {vocalsound}",
      "Industrial Designer : Yeah , yeah .",
      "Marketing : Yeah . Um , for for innovation , so we've got the speech the speech thing , and {disfmarker}",
      "Project Manager : {vocalsound} Mm-hmm . I would've said about a two as well .",
      "Marketing : Do you reckon a two ?",
      "User Interface : Yeah , two or three . I'd be happy with a two .",
      "Marketing : {vocalsound} Okay . Two .",

      "User Interface : {vocalsound}",
      "Project Manager : The next on Well , I can just sing about . Easy to use . I would've said yes . I would go for a one on that at this point in time .",
      "User Interface : Yeah . Yeah ,",
      "Marketing : Okay .",
      "User Interface : I would say so as well .",
      "Project Manager : Um , incorporates elements of fashion to attract buyer . Well , yeah it certainly has some .",
      "Industrial Designer : Um {disfmarker}",
      "Project Manager : {vocalsound} {gap} .",
      "User Interface : Yeah , it's got the cherry and the sponginess .",

      "Marketing : Say about a three maybe ?",
      "Project Manager : I don't know .",
      "Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Yeah , m um {disfmarker}",
      "User Interface : Maybe two ?",
      "Industrial Designer : Yeah , it was just doing it quite well .",
      "Project Manager : Yep .",
      "Industrial Designer : Um , I think we're gonna have to lose some of these , but the moment , as it stands , it's um {disfmarker}",
      "Project Manager : Yeah , I woulda said two would seem reasonable .",
      "Marketing : It's a two .",
      "Project Manager : The product is a recognisable real {disfmarker} r uh {disfmarker} reaction product ?",
      "Marketing : Yeah , this is {disfmarker}",
      "Industrial Designer : Uh {gap} the sensor using all of its all of its products , all of its buttons ,",
      "Marketing : This {disfmarker}",
      "Project Manager : {vocalsound}",
      "Industrial Designer : and it's got a fairly big label on the bottom saying where it comes from .",
      "User Interface : Yeah , that's a bit rough at the minute . {vocalsound}",
      "Marketing : Yeah . {vocalsound} So this is about sort of the corporate image of like new sort of sleek technology and all that sort of thing , as well as having the logo on and all that .",
      "Project Manager : Oh .",
      "Industrial Designer : Okay .",
      "Marketing : So {gap} sort of {disfmarker} Is it sort of a recognisable product .",
      "Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}",
      "Project Manager : {vocalsound}",
      "Marketing : Does it fit in with our other other products , which uh are sort of coffee makers and spacecraft . {vocalsound}",

      "Marketing : {vocalsound}",
      "User Interface : Uh , well it's got the same um speech feature as the coffee machine .",
      "Marketing : What do y",

      "Industrial Designer : Um , it depends which way you look at it .",
      "Marketing : Uh-huh .",

Mr. Chair, last week markets were shocked when leaks regarding the state of our economy came to light before the market even opened. This caused worry to investors at home and abroad about the integrity of our markets and the nature of the leak, which is, in itself, unprecedented. Section 34 of the Statistics Act indicates the following:     Every person who, after taking the oath set out in subsection 6, is guity of an offence and liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding five thousand dollars or to impreisonment for a term not exceeing five years or both:       wilfully discloses or divulges directly or indirectly to any person not entitled under this Act to receive the same any information obtained by him in the course of his employment that might exert an influence on or affect the market value of any stocks, bonds or other security or any product or article, or       uses any information described in paragraph for the purpose of speculating in any stocks, bonds or other security or any product or article   My question for the minister is this: Does the government consider this case to be subject to paragraph 34 or 34 and a criminal offence, yes or no?",

      "Hon. Navdeep Bains (Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry) : Mr. Chair, my hon. colleague is absolutely right that the current situation with regard to the COVID crisis is deeply problematic, and we want to make sure that any information we share with the Canadian public with regard to economic measures or labour market numbers follows the appropriate process. The breach that occurred is completely unacceptable. Our government has denounced this breach. That breach was not the way to deal with such sensitive information. The member has alluded to several paragraphs within the Statistics Act. I can assure him that we are looking into this matter and that Statistics Canada is looking into this issue as well. Going forward, we will ensure that such a breach does not occur again, because it's important that we continue to have the confidence of Canadians during this current health care crisis.",

      "Mr. Ziad Aboultaif : In that case, the minister said the matter will be looked into. Basically, my understanding of this case is that Statistics Canada is going to investigate itself, or does the minister think that the government should refer this to the RCMP?",

      "Mr. Ziad Aboultaif : Will Statistics Canada investigate itself or will the government refer this to the RCMP?",

      "Lynne Neagle AM : Okay. Thank you. We've got some questions now on healthy environments from Dawn Bowden.",
      "Dawn Bowden AM : Thank you, Chair. In the draft plan, some of the measures in there suggest legislating for restricting price promotions and banning energy drinks, and that sort of thing. Do you think that, if we go down that road, there's going to be time within this Assembly to introduce such legislation? And, if not, what do you think might be the timescale for such legislation?",
      "Dr Frank Atherton : It may well be that there are things in Wales that we might wish to legislate on, and you've mentioned two of them, and they're good examples. We would, obviously, need to undertake quite detailed consultation on those and, in a way, we need to mirror what's happening in England and in Scotland\u00a0to some degree around the consultations they're having on energy drinks. We also need to influence the issues that are not devolved to us and we seek to do that. As to your question of legislative time, I'm not really in a position to answer that. What I could say is that legislation may well be one of the outcomes of the consultation. There may well be things that we wish to choose to legislate on. The timing of that will have to be subject to other pressures, and I come back to the point that legislation, of course, is one of the tools that we've got\u2014we need to deploy them all.",
      "Dawn Bowden AM : Sure, I understand that, that you could do other things. I know\u2014. We've heard from the Government, on other calls for legislation, that the programme's very tight, certainly for this term, so I was just wondering whether we might get that in, but okay. If I turn now to the planning system\u2014and this might not be something that you have great deal of knowledge of; I'd just welcome your view on this, because, when we discussed with stakeholders, we talked about whether the planning system, for instance, could be used to, as an example, restrict hot food takeaways around schools and so on. Would that be a measure that you would support, something like that?",
      "Dr Frank Atherton : I think it's definitely something we want to look at and, of course, that question is asked in the consultation, so we would like to know people's views on that. It's an interesting one. I think there is a question\u2014a really important question\u2014about how we can use the planning system more effectively. I've discussed with Nathan on a number of occasions, with planning colleagues in Welsh Government and in local authorities, about the art of the possible, let's say. There may be things that we could think about and we want to get those ideas through the consultation. The specific question around takeaways, particularly takeaways near schools, is often asked. I was very interested to see, up in the north-east, some time ago, that one of the local authorities up there did put a moratorium on the opening of new fast-food venues near to schools, or indeed in areas where levels of obesity and overweight were particularly high. I understand London is now\u2014some London boroughs are now\u2014experimenting with that as well. So, that gave me comfort, because maybe there are powers within local authorities that can be used more effectively.\u00a0I think my view at the moment is that the jury's kind of out on whether those are effective and how effective they're going to be. But the fact that we have some initiatives around the UK does give us an opportunity to study that and to learn from experience perhaps and then, if it is shown to be beneficial, to think about that here in Wales, yes.",
      "Dawn Bowden AM : Sure, because it will only be one of a suite of measures anyway. Of itself, it wouldn't address the problem, but, added to other initiatives, I guess it would. Can I just ask you briefly, then, about community sport infrastructure and, in particular, of new schools? So, Welsh Government, as you know, has ploughed a huge amount of money into the twenty-first century schools programme. What we heard when we spoke to stakeholders recently, particularly headteachers, was that, in some of the new schools that have been built, we haven't had changing rooms and toilet facilities, for instance, built into the new buildings. So, if we're going to try and utilise these buildings for general community activity to get kids and the wider public, actually, more active, do you think that's something that we ought to be building in? Again, not your particular direct area of responsibility, but something that you might have an input into, is that, when we're developing schools, we should be making sure that they have those kinds of facilities so that they become accessible to the wider public. Is that something that you would be prepared to make a recommendation around?",
      "Dr Frank Atherton : Well, it's certainly a fascinating area and one that I think has a lot of potential. It goes\u2014. You're right to raise it in the context of schools, and I can understand why this committee would, but I think it goes beyond that, actually, into all developments in the public sector and how they're developed and whether we're building health into our environment, which perhaps is your starting point. One of the things that I was really pleased to see in terms of the Public Health (Wales) Act 2017 that was passed a couple of years ago was the use of health impact assessment as a tool, and we're still working on how that will inform policy and how that will be applied in issues such as policy decisions through Government, but also in more downstream issues about how we create the public infrastructure that the public can and should be using. And so I would like to see the use of health impact assessments to a much greater degree to inform those kinds of decisions. If you apply that kind of lens and you take the point, which is inherent in your question, I think, that schools are not just for kids, they're for communities, then you would\u2014it would lead you to a conclusion that you would perhaps design and build them in a different way. So, on a personal basis, I would certainly support your view that we should be looking to use the sports environment in schools in the same way as we use leisure centres. There are all kinds of barriers in there, and I understand all of that, and it's not really my field, exactly as you say, but, as a matter of principle, I think it's a good one to pursue.",

        "summary": "The Industrial Designer made a slide presentation to present his new industrial design for the remote control. On a slide, he expressed his will to make it infrared instead of laser. He considered that technology would be better to control the TV and cheaper than laser, with a cost of approximately eight Euros. On the next slides, he explained the remote control would have an infrared bulb and provided some electronic components' explanation. On the last slide, he stated the remote control should be wireless, but this would also raise the question of how to charge it. The User Interface was surprised with the wireless remote-control idea using a wire to charge. The Industrial Designer added it could be both: with a wire or not. The Marketing was very interested in the cost and raised the user's point of view to have a wireless remote control. The project Manager stepped in to ask if a cable between the remote control and the TV would be a good idea and mostly would it be cheaper. The Industrial Designer acknowledged using a wire would be cheaper but less practical. The project Manager focused on the people's point of view if to have it, wireless and believed it would be easier to have a link between the remote control and the television. The Marketing started his presentation. He pointed several issues out: the remote control presented too many buttons, it got often lost in the room, difficult to learn and RSI problems. The Marketing personal preferences were to meet the user needs and to make it fancy to sell more than the concurrent and definitively with fewer buttons. The Project Manager directly asked the User Interface if it would be possible to have fewer buttons and still have the same functionality and a powerful remote control. The User interface answered it would be possible by assigning several functions to the same button.",

The user presses a button . The remote determines what button it is , uses the infrared to send a signal to the T_V_ . The T_V_ switches to the frequency , or what function it is . So we've got um the the plate . It gots conductive disks for every button . When the user presses a button , a signal got sent , goes to the LED and transmits tranmi transmits its to the T_V_ . It's a very simple device , technically speaking . So this is a schematic overview . You've got the buttons . The power source . And uh when a button gets pressed , its goes to the chip . The chip uh controls the infrared bulb and perf perhaps a normal bulb . When you press a button you can actually see your pressed button . Well um I think we should use default materials , simple plastics . Keep the inner workings simple , so it's robust . Uh I think we should focus on aesthetics , the design and the user interface , because if you're going to use high-tech materials the price is going to go sky-high . And uh you only have to design a remote once , and if you use high-tech materials it come back in every product . So it's , in my idea , it's uh it's gonna be smart to invest in di in design and not in uh in the product itself . That's it .",
