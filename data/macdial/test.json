The farm would have a number of utilities that would make it very easy to run things using P-make and Customs. PhD F explained that there was a command called \"run-command\" with which the system would find the fastest way to run the job on an available machine, exporting the job there and duplicating the environment. Each machine that would be part of the network would have associated attributes about the amount of memory on the machine, its speed, and the operating system, so that when they used the run command, those attributes could be specified. If there was a job running on the machine you were trying to select, your job would be queued and then when the resource or machine became available, your job would be exported there. Grad G asked what if they had thousands of little jobs to do. PhD F said that they could write a script called run-command for each sub-job, but that they shouldn't run more than 10 jobs at a time because they could saturate the network and delay other people's work. PhD F said it was possible to use the run command in this case, but the program wouldn't know that other tasks were running, instead, if you wrote a P-make file, you could define how many tasks there would be and how many machines could be used simultaneously. Professor C asked why to use the make command instead of P-make. PhD F said that if you didn't want to write a P-make script and someone was using the machine you normally use, you could use \"run-command\" and the program would find the best available machine and run your work there. Professor C asked if anyone could stop the work of that machine by pressing a button. PhD F said that some machines in the institute had an attribute called \"no evict\", and if specified, the job would go to a machine that would not be evicted from its work, because although work would restart on another machine automatically if someone evicted it, it may be a waste of time. Professor C asked what if someone worked from home and needed to evict work from their computer to use it, but needed someone to press a key to be able to do it. PhD F said Andreas did something about it. Professor C said you could ask Andreas.",

      "Professor C : Sunil 's here for the summer , right . Um , so , one thing is to talk about a kick off meeting maybe uh , and then just uh , I guess uh , progress reports individually , and then uh , plans for where we go between now and then , pretty much . Um .",
      "PhD F : I could say a few words about um , some of the uh , compute stuff that 's happening around here , so that people in the group know .",
      "Professor C : Mm - hmm . OK . Why don't you start with that ? That 's sort of {disfmarker}",
      "PhD F : OK .",
      "Professor C : Yeah ?",
      "PhD F : We um {disfmarker} So we just put in an order for about twelve new machines , uh , to use as sort of a compute farm . And um , uh , we ordered uh , SUN - Blade - one - hundreds , and um , I 'm not sure exactly how long it 'll take for those to come in , but , uh , in addition , we 're running {disfmarker} So the plan for using these is , uh , we 're running P - make and Customs here and Andreas has sort of gotten that all uh , fixed up and up to speed . And he 's got a number of little utilities that make it very easy to um , {vocalsound} run things using P - make and Customs . You don't actually have to write P - make scripts and things like that . The simplest thing {disfmarker} And I can send an email around or , maybe I should do an FAQ on the web site about it or something . Um ,",
      "Professor C : How about an email that points to the FAQ ,",
      "PhD F : there 's a c",
      "Professor C : you know what I 'm saying ?",
      "PhD F : Yeah , yeah .",
      "Professor C : so that you can {disfmarker} Yeah .",
      "PhD F : Uh , there 's a command , uh , that you can use called \" run command \" . \" Run dash command \" , \" run hyphen command \" . And , if you say that and then some job that you want to execute , uh , it will find the fastest currently available machine , and export your job to that machine , and uh {disfmarker} and run it there and it 'll duplicate your environment . So you can try this as a simple test with uh , the L S command . So you can say \" run dash command L S \" , and , um , it 'll actually export that {vocalsound} LS command to some machine in the institute , and um , do an LS on your current directory . So , substitute LS for whatever command you want to run , and um {disfmarker} And that 's a simple way to get started using {disfmarker} using this . And , so , soon , when we get all the new machines up , {vocalsound} um , e then we 'll have lots more compute to use . Now th one of the nice things is that uh , each machine that 's part of the P - make and Customs network has attributes associated with it . Uh , attributes like how much memory the machine has , what its speed is , what its operating system , and when you use something like \" run command \" , you can specify those attributes for your program . For example if you only want your thing to run under Linux , you can give it the Linux attribute , and then it will find the fastest available Linux machine and run it on that . So . You can control where your jobs go , to a certain extent , all the way down to an individual machine . Each machine has an attribute which is the name of itself . So you can give that as an attribute and it 'll only run on that . If there 's already a job running , on some machine that you 're trying to select , your job will get queued up , and then when that resource , that machine becomes available , your job will get exported there . So , there 's a lot of nice features to it and it kinda helps to balance the load of the machines and uh , right now Andreas and I have been the main ones using it and we 're {disfmarker} Uh . The SRI recognizer has all this P - make customs stuff built into it .",
      "Professor C : So as I understand , you know , he 's using all the machines and you 're using all the machines ,",
      "PhD F : So .",
      "Professor C : is the rough division of {disfmarker}",
      "PhD F : Yeah . Exactly . Yeah , you know , I {disfmarker} I sort of got started {comment} using the recognizer just recently and uh , uh I fired off a training job , and then I fired off a recognition job and I get this email about midnight from Andreas saying , \" uh , are you running two {vocalsound} trainings simultaneously s my m my jobs are not getting run . \" So I had to back off a little bit . But , soon as we get some more machines then uh {disfmarker} then we 'll have more compute available . So , um , that 's just a quick update about what we 've got . So .",
      "Grad G : Um , I have {disfmarker} I have a question about the uh , parallelization ?",
      "PhD F : Mm - hmm .",
      "Grad G : So , um , let 's say I have like , a thousand little {disfmarker} little jobs to do ?",
      "PhD F : Mm - hmm .",
      "Grad G : Um , how do I do it with \" run command \" ? I mean do {disfmarker}",
      "PhD F : You could write a script uh , which called run command on each sub - job",
      "Grad G : Uh - huh . A thousand times ?",
      "PhD F : right ? But you probably wanna be careful with that",
      "Grad G : OK .",
      "PhD F : because um , you don't wanna saturate the network . Uh , so , um , you know , you should {disfmarker} you should probably not run more than , say ten jobs yourself at any one time , uh , just because then it would keep other people {disfmarker}",
      "Grad G : Oh , too much file transfer and stuff .",
      "PhD F : Well it 's not that so much as that , you know , e with {disfmarker} if everybody ran fifty jobs at once then it would just bring everything to a halt and , you know , people 's jobs would get delayed , so it 's sort of a sharing thing . Um ,",
      "Grad G : OK .",
      "PhD F : so you should try to limit it to somet sometim some number around ten jobs at a time . Um . So if you had a script for example that had a thousand things it needed to run , um , you 'd somehow need to put some logic in there if you were gonna use \" run command \" , uh , to only have ten of those going at a time . And uh , then , when one of those finished you 'd fire off another one . Um ,",
      "Professor C : I remember I {disfmarker} I forget whether it was when the Rutgers or {disfmarker} or Hopkins workshop , I remember one of the workshops I was at there were {disfmarker} everybody was real excited cuz they got twenty - five machines and there was some kind of P - make like thing that sit sent things out .",
      "PhD F : Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .",
      "Professor C : So all twenty - five people were sending things to all twenty - five machines",
      "PhD F : Mm - hmm . Yeah .",
      "Professor C : and {vocalsound} and things were a lot less efficient than if you 'd just use your own machine .",
      "PhD F : Yeah . Yep . Yeah , exactly . Yeah , you have to be a little bit careful .",
      "Professor C : as I recall , but . Yeah .",
      "PhD D : Hmm .",
      "PhD F : Um , but uh , you can also {disfmarker} If you have that level of parallelization um , and you don't wanna have to worry about writing the logic in {disfmarker} in a Perl script to take care of that , you can use um , P - make",
      "Grad G : Just do P - make .",
      "PhD F : and {disfmarker} and you basically write a Make file that uh , you know your final job depends on these one thousand things ,",
      "Grad G : s Mm - hmm .",
      "PhD F : and when you run P - make , uh , on your Make file , you can give it the dash capital J and {disfmarker} and then a number ,",
      "Grad G : Mm - hmm .",
      "PhD F : and that number represents how many uh , machines to use at once . And then it 'll make sure that it never goes above that .",
      "Grad G : Right .",
      "PhD F : So ,",
      "Grad G : Right . OK .",
      "PhD F : I can get some documentation .",
      "PhD D : So it {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} it 's not systematically queued . I mean all the jobs are running . If you launch twenty jobs , they are all running . Alright .",
      "PhD F : It depends . If you {disfmarker} \" Run command \" , that I mentioned before , is {disfmarker} doesn't know about other things that you might be running .",
      "PhD D : Uh - huh .",
      "PhD F : So , it would be possible to run a hundred run jobs at once ,",
      "PhD D : Right .",
      "PhD F : and they wouldn't know about each other . But if you use P - make , then , it knows about all the jobs that it has to run",
      "PhD D : Mm - hmm .",
      "PhD F : and it can control , uh , how many it runs simultaneously .",
      "Professor C : So \" run command \" doesn't use P - make , or {disfmarker} ?",
      "PhD F : It uses \" export \" underlyingly . But , if you {disfmarker} i It 's meant to be run one job at a time ? So you could fire off a thousand of those , and it doesn't know {disfmarker} any one of those doesn't know about the other ones that are running .",
      "Professor C : So why would one use that rather than P - make ?",
      "PhD F : Well , if you have , um {disfmarker} Like , for example , uh if you didn't wanna write a P - make script and you just had a , uh {disfmarker} an HTK training job that you know is gonna take uh , six hours to run , and somebody 's using , uh , the machine you typically use , you can say \" run command \" and your HTK thing and it 'll find another machine , the fastest currently available machine and {disfmarker} and run your job there .",
      "Professor C : Now , does it have the same sort of behavior as P - make , which is that , you know , if you run something on somebody 's machine and they come in and hit a key then it {disfmarker}",
      "PhD F : Yes . Yeah , there are um {disfmarker} Right . So some of the machines at the institute , um , have this attribute called \" no evict \" . And if you specify that , in {disfmarker} in one of your attribute lines , then it 'll go to a machine which your job won't be evicted from .",
      "Professor C : Mm - hmm .",
      "PhD F : But , the machines that don't have that attribute , if a job gets fired up on that , which could be somebody 's desktop machine , and {disfmarker} and they were at lunch ,",
      "Professor C : Mm - hmm .",
      "PhD F : they come back from lunch and they start typing on the console , then your machine will get evicted {disfmarker} your job {comment} will get evicted from their machine and be restarted on another machine . Automatically . So {disfmarker} which can cause you to lose time , right ? If you had a two hour job , and it got halfway through and then somebody came back to their machine and it got evicted . So . If you don't want your job to run on a machine where it could be evicted , then you give it the minus {disfmarker} the attribute , you know , \" no evict \" , and it 'll pick a machine that it can't be evicted from . So .",
      "Professor C : Um , what {disfmarker} what about {disfmarker} I remember always used to be an issue , maybe it 's not anymore , that if you {disfmarker} if something required {disfmarker} if your machine required somebody hitting a key in order to evict things that are on it so you could work , but if you were logged into it from home ?",
      "PhD F : Mm - hmm .",

Um , another thing I think we d missed out on on the last meeting was the fact that we should consider the environmental impact of our design .

      "Industrial Designer : So they can be heated and um and cooled , and they change the shape of um the metal . So , for example , a screw that's holding something together could expand and it would force all the components apart . So um , the benefits of this for our product would be that when it came to the end of its product life , if it was heated , um everything would spring apart . So , all the um individual components could be easily separated , and then some could be reused , some could be recycled , and I think that would be very important for products now . Especially 'cause there's much uh responsibility for all the um companies who are coming up with like new designs . 'Cause all , we all know that our resources are being limited , and we have to be very environmentally conscious .",

      "Industrial Designer : Yeah .",
      "Project Manager : So that , um , someone could have this product for as long as they felt that they wanted it , and then once they contribute it , then that company can break down the part , the parts better ?",
      "Industrial Designer : Um {disfmarker} And then {disfmarker} Yeah . Yeah they would , um you would make the , the product as you normally would , apart from the , the bits that hold it all together would be made out of this shape-memory alloy . And that's the part that would um allow all the other parts to be separated at the end . I mean , the user would return the p product to the company , 'cause it's the product's responsibility to get rid of what they've made .

      "Lynne Neagle AM : Hefin David has some questions now on fee and access plans.",
      "Hefin David AM : Are you concerned that neither the regulator nor the sector seem to have any confidence in fee and access plans?",
      "Kirsty Williams AM : I think the concept of a fee and access plan is an important concept. Whether we can do them better, whether we can reflect on what's happened to date and create a better system of what's included in a fee and access plan and how those fee and access plans can be monitored, there's an opportunity to do that in forthcoming legislation.",
      "Hefin David AM : So, have you been aware of specific issues yourself? Have they brought them to you?",
      "Kirsty Williams AM : Well, no, not in the sense that they've brought them to me to talk about specifically. From my perspective, fee and access plans are focused very much on inputs, and, really, I'd like to think about outputs and outcomes, more importantly\u2014what are the outcomes of the fee and access plan, not necessarily just how much money has been spent on them. I think, certainly, to really understand the success of the fee and access plan, you have to question whether an annual basis is an appropriate timescale for a university to be working to, and whether we could have something that was focused over a longer period of time. Because, when you think about it, you write the plan and then you're into it, and then, the next thing you know, you're writing your next year's plan. So, I think there's an opportunity there to look to restructure. So, do I see a place for fee and access plans going forward, as part of our outcome agreements? Yes, I do. Can we do them differently to make them more effective? Yes, I think we can.",
      "Hefin David AM : So, why would introducing outcome agreements make them work any better?",
      "Kirsty Williams AM : Well, I think they're going to be a part of an outcome agreement\u2014part of that wider expectation. So, fee and access plans are there to address an issue around, primarily, changing the nature of people who go to university and making sure that nobody is put off from pursuing that. So, that's part of a wider piece of work that I'd want to see as an outcome agreement. But, as I said, I think looking at outcomes for students and outcomes of that activity, rather than the inputs of the activity, over a longer period of time, is probably a more effective way of doing it. I think it's still\u2014. In a way, it's difficult to make a final judgment on whether fee and access plans in their current format have worked, because we need to know what'll happen to those students in the future. But undoubtedly, despite the limitations of them, I do think we're making progress in terms of access, but I don't think we can necessarily point to the fee and access plans as being the driver for some of those improvements.",
      "Hefin David AM : No, I appreciate that, and some of the things you're saying reflect some of the discussions we've had, but what was clear is that the process and bureaucratic nature of the way you present fee and access plans doesn't work, particularly given the fact that, four years on, early fee and access plans are still being evaluated. There's a real problem there. So, what you're saying\u2014can I just pin down what you're saying\u2014is that we may be moving away from yearly fee and access plans to something that's longer term and outcome focused.",
      "Kirsty Williams AM : That's my preference.\u00a0So, I think the principle\u2014I'd like to think we can all agree around the principle of what a fee and access plan is hoping to achieve, but I think there are better ways of doing it, and I think we should take the opportunity of reform to look at how we can do it better.",
      "Hefin David AM : So, with that in mind, I think we're talking about the future of the Bill, the consultation on the PCET reforms closed in summer 2018\u2014with these important issues in mind and things that are currently ongoing, have you had further dialogue since then with key stakeholders like, for example, Universities Wales and others?",
      "Kirsty Williams AM : On the Bill or on fee and access plans in particular?",
      "Hefin David AM : I'm thinking about fee and access plans as an issue that suggests that there is a need for deep consultation, so with that in mind, with things like that, have you had further discussion?",
      "Kirsty Williams AM : Oh my goodness me, civil servants in the department are constantly in discussion with a range of stakeholders as we continue to develop legislative proposals. I meet on a regular basis with both HEFCW\u2014I meet separately with the vice-chancellors, and I've been very keen to develop a stronger working relationship with chairs, and perhaps we'll come on to issues of governance later. So, we are constantly discussing with stakeholders all options for change\u2014",
      "Hefin David AM : I suppose the message I'm getting as chair of the cross-party group on higher education is that there could still be more direct consultation with stakeholders. That's the message I've received. Now, I've got no evidence to say it has or hasn't happened, but that's the message I've received.",
      "Huw Morris : If I could just chip in for a moment, the Minister's outlined that there is very extensive, ongoing communication both ways with the sector, but the challenge of preparing a Bill is the balancing act between gathering in information\u2014and there's been a general consultation process and a technical consultation process\u2014and wanting to make sure that the Bill that's laid next year hasn't been discussed with anybody else before it comes to be considered by the Senedd. So, the broad principles have been discussed, but specific details of what goes into a Bill or policy instructions that inform a Bill haven't been the subject of consultation\u2014",
      "Hefin David AM : Because that happens at Stage 1.",
      "Huw Morris : Indeed, yes."

      "Professor F : so i it {disfmarker} it may not apply . But my recollection of it was that it didn't make it better but it didn't make it worse .",
      "PhD D : Hmm .",
      "Professor F : But , again , given all these differences , maybe it 's more important in your case that you not take a lot of these low - variance , uh , components .",
      "PhD D : Cuz in a sense , the net 's already got quite a bit of context in those features ,",
      "Professor F : Yeah .",
      "PhD D : so if we did deltas and double - deltas on top of those , we 're getting sort of even more .",
      "Professor F : Which could be good or not .",
      "PhD D : Yeah .",
      "Professor F : Yeah . Yeah . Worth trying .",
      "PhD C : But there the main point is that , um , you know , it took us a while but we have the procedure for coupling the two systems {vocalsound} debugged now and {disfmarker} I mean , there 's still conceivably some bug somewhere in the way we 're feeding the tandem features {disfmarker} uh , either generating them or feeding them to this {disfmarker} to the {vocalsound} SRI system ,",
      "PhD D : Mm - hmm . Yeah .",
      "PhD C : but it 's {disfmarker}",
      "Professor F : There might be , cuz that 's a pretty big difference .",
      "PhD C : Yeah . And I 'm wondering how we can {disfmarker} how we can debug that .",
      "Professor F : But",
      "PhD D : Yeah .",
      "PhD C : I mean how {disfmarker} Um .",
      "Professor F : Hmm .",
      "PhD C : I 'm actually f quite sure that the {disfmarker} feeding the {pause} features into the system and training it up ,",

      "PhD D : Yeah . There could be a bug in {disfmarker} in the {disfmarker} somewhere before that .",
      "PhD C : There {disfmarker} we could {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} another degree of freedom is how do you generate the K L T transform ?",
      "PhD D : Mm - hmm .",
      "PhD C : Right ? We to",
      "Professor F : That 's {disfmarker}",
      "PhD D : Right .",
      "Professor F : well , and another one is the normalization of the inputs to the net .",
      "PhD C : Yeah .",
      "Professor F : These nets are trained with particular normalization and when that gets screwed up it {disfmarker} it can really hurt it .",
      "PhD D : I 'm doing what Eric {disfmarker} E Eric coached me through then {disfmarker} that part of it , so I 'm pretty confident in that .",
      "Professor F : OK .",
      "PhD D : I mean , the only slight difference is that I use normalization values that , um , Andreas calculated from the original {comment} PLP ,",
      "PhD C : Right .",
      "PhD D : which is right .",
      "PhD C : Right .",
      "PhD D : N Yeah . So , I u I do {disfmarker} Oh , we actually don't do that normalization for the PLP , do we ? For the st just the straight PLP features ?",
      "PhD C : No . The {disfmarker} the SRI system does it .",
      "PhD D : S R I system does that . Right .",
      "PhD C : Yeah .",
      "Professor F : Right . Well , you might e e",
      "PhD C : So , there 's {disfmarker} there is {disfmarker} there is room for bugs that we might not have discovered ,",

      "Professor F : Yeah .",
      "PhD D : Mm - hmm .",

      "PhD D : Yeah . It 's hard with features , cuz you don't know what they should look like . I mean , you can't just , like , print the {disfmarker} the values out in ASCII and , you know , look at them , see if they 're {disfmarker}",
      "Professor F : Not unless you had a lot of time",
      "PhD G : Well {disfmarker}",
      "Professor F : and {disfmarker}",
      "PhD G : eh , and also they 're not {disfmarker} I mean , as I understand it , you {disfmarker} you don't have a way to optimize the features for the final word error . Right ?",
      "PhD C : Right .",
      "PhD G : I mean , these are just discriminative , but they 're not , um , optimized for the final {disfmarker}",
      "PhD C : They 're optimized for phone discrimination , not for {disfmarker}",
      "PhD G : Right . So it {disfmarker} there 's always this question of whether you might do better with those features if there was a way to train it for the word error metric that you 're actually {disfmarker} that you 're actually {disfmarker}",
      "Professor F : That 's right . Well , the other {disfmarker} Yeah , th the {disfmarker}",
      "PhD C : Mm - Mmm .",
      "Professor F : Well , you actually are . But {disfmarker} but it {disfmarker} but in an indirect way .",
      "PhD G : Well , right . It 's indirect , so you don't know {disfmarker}",
      "Professor F : So wha w what {disfmarker} an and you may not be in this case , come to think of it , because , uh , you 're just taking something that 's trained up elsewhere . So , what {disfmarker} what you {disfmarker} what you do in the full procedure {vocalsound} is you , um , uh , have an embedded training . So in fact you {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the net is trained on , uh , uh , a , uh , Viterbi alignment of the training data that comes from your full system . And so that 's where the feedback comes all around , so that it is actually discriminant . You can prove that it 's {disfmarker} it 's a , uh {disfmarker} If you believe in the Viterbi assumption that , uh , getting the best path , uh , is almost equivalent to getting the best , uh , total probability , um , then you actually do improve that by , uh {disfmarker} by training up on local {disfmarker} local , uh {disfmarker} local frames . But , um , we aren't actually doing that here , because we did {disfmarker} we did that for a hybrid system , and now we 're plugging it into another system and so it isn't {disfmarker} {vocalsound} i i i it wouldn't quite apply here .",
      "PhD C : Do y",
      "PhD D : So another huge experiment we could do would be to take the tandem features , uh , do SRI forced alignments using those features , and then re - do the net with those .",
      "Professor F : Mm - hmm .",
      "PhD G : Mmm , uh {disfmarker} Exactly . Exactly .",
      "Professor F : Yeah .",
      "PhD G : So that you can optimize it for the word error .",
      "PhD C : But {disfmarker}",
      "Professor F : Yeah . Another thing is since you 're not using the net for recognition per se but just for this transformation , it 's probably bigger than it needs to be .",
      "PhD G : Yeah .",
      "Professor F : So that would save a lot of time .",
      "PhD C : And there 's a mismatch in the phone sets . So , you 're using a l a long a larger phone set than what {disfmarker}",
      "PhD D : Mmm .",

      "PhD D : Yeah . Yeah .",
      "Professor F : The other thing , uh , just to mention that Stephane {disfmarker} this was an innovation of Stephane 's , which was a pretty neat one , uh , and might particularly apply {vocalsound} here , given all these things we 're mentioning . Um , Stephane 's idea was that , um , discriminant , uh , approaches are great . Even the local ones , given , you know , these potential outer loops which , you know , you can convince yourself turn into the global ones . Um , however , there 's times when it {pause} is not good . Uh , when {pause} something about the test set is different enough from the training set that {disfmarker} that , uh , the discrimination that you 're learning is {disfmarker} is {disfmarker} is not a good one .",
      "PhD C : Mm - hmm .",

      "PhD C : Yeah . No , but we {disfmarker} we {disfmarker} when {disfmarker} when we {disfmarker} when I first started corresponding with Dan about how to go about this , I think that was one of the things that we definitely went there .",
      "PhD G : or {disfmarker} ? Oh . That makes a lot of sense . Huh .",
      "Professor F : Yeah . Yeah . I mean , I 'm sure that Stephane wasn't the first to think of it ,",
      "PhD C : Yeah .",

      "PhD C : Uh - huh . And i does it help ?",
      "Professor F : and {disfmarker} {vocalsound} and {disfmarker} and it helped a lot .",
      "PhD C : Oh , OK .",
      "Professor F : Yeah . So that 's {disfmarker} that {disfmarker} that 's our current best {disfmarker} best system in the , uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} uh , in the Aurora thing .",
      "PhD C : Oh . OK .",

      "Professor F : Yeah .",
      "PhD C : OK .",

      "PhD C : Because you end up with this huge feature vector , so that might be a problem , a unless you do some form of dimensionality reduction .",
      "Professor F : Yeah . I , uh , th what I don't remember is which came out best . So he did one where he put o put e the whole thing into one KLT , and another one , since the {disfmarker} the PLP things are already orthogonalized , he left them alone and {disfmarker} and just did a KLT on the {disfmarker} on the {disfmarker} on the net outputs",

Okay , first uh the {disfmarker} Into the method . The the main idea of the whole thing is just so you sh you just press buttons and it should activate things on the T_V_ and we discussed last meeting that it should be easy to find . Um also in this study I've looked into the availability of some of the materials , 'cause some of the things that we looked at last time aren't {disfmarker} un unfortunately aren't available .",

      "Project Manager : Wa {vocalsound} can you explain that ?",
      "Industrial Designer : people won't {disfmarker} it's it's basically like wind-up radio .",
      "Project Manager : Like a {disfmarker} right , okay .",

      "Industrial Designer : You {disfmarker} Yeah , yeah , oh yeah I presu you wouldn't have to wind it for very long , but I don't I don't think it's really sort of necessary when you th you think of the next two options , like the the solar charging , 'cause most people have the light on in the room anyway so they could get {disfmarker} when when you got T_V_ .",

      "User Interface : Night .",
      "Project Manager : Mm , but then it would be charging through the day , I think the point is that it charges through the day and then you've got it charged for the evening .",

      "Project Manager : Okay .",

      "Marketing : Mm-hmm .",
      "Industrial Designer : Yeah but then again",
      "Project Manager : Is it really gonna be enough ?",
      "Industrial Designer : I I think it is because if you think about it , the watch , although it's only a tiny amount it's it's um {vocalsound} it's always moving for the whole day and they don't run out over night when you leave them on the side .",
      "Project Manager : Okay .",

      "Marketing : Mm-hmm . Mm .",

      "Marketing : Could I just ask {disfmarker} referring back to solar charging , is that compatible with um standard batteries ?",
      "Industrial Designer : Mm .",
      "Marketing : I mean , could people put standard batteries in but with a s you know they could leave it in the sunlight for solar charging",
      "Industrial Designer : Ye yeah I think I th uh g y you could have a dual um power thing",
      "Marketing : or the two things not compatible ?",
      "Project Manager : Like a dual kind of .",
      "Industrial Designer : but the the thing with the solar cells is you would need to put them on the case and they {disfmarker} because , if you lie {gap} {disfmarker} on a calculator they they're qui they're quite big and they all they all look i identical .",
      "Marketing : Mm . So that affects the exterior design .",
      "User Interface : Solar would be slightly {gap} expensives .",

      "Industrial Designer : They're they're expensive , they don't {disfmarker}",

      "Project Manager : I presume the normal batteries are the cheapest ?",

      "Project Manager : Solar .",
      "Industrial Designer : 'cause if you drop stuff {disfmarker} yeah if you if you have y",
      "Project Manager : Well they're not designed {disfmarker}",
      "Industrial Designer : the size you'd need to charge a remote wouldn't be that big but I mean if {disfmarker} remotes always get thrown around and stuff , so .",
      "Project Manager : Practical-wise okay .",
      "Industrial Designer : Y I think {disfmarker} yeah , practically . I mean calculators you don't really throw around a lot {vocalsound} whereas remotes you do ,",
      "Project Manager : You do get a bit of wear",
      "Industrial Designer : they can t",
      "Project Manager : but don't calculators have a battery in them as well ?",
      "Industrial Designer : Yeah they do , they {disfmarker} yeah they've got dual things , but they're {disfmarker} the batteries are smaller I think .",
      "Project Manager : Mm .",
      "Marketing : Mm .",
      "User Interface : Another question is like {disfmarker}",
      "Marketing : Again it de",
      "User Interface : sorry . W w which one would last the longest , because we don't want customers to be like you know charging like a mobile phone every day .",
      "Industrial Designer : Mm .",
      "User Interface : A remote control , like ,",
      "Industrial Designer : W m yeah",
      "User Interface : so we have to s look at the life also .",
      "Marketing : Mm .",
      "Industrial Designer : so the {disfmarker} Yeah the the s if you if you had something du uh using the standard batteries and the solar charging , um , I don't think you'd {disfmarker} I think the {disfmarker} it would d well you know how long the standard double A_s would last in {disfmarker} or triple A_s would last .",
      "Marketing : It would just detract from the attractiveness of the of the whole feature ,",
      "Industrial Designer : Yeah I think i I think it would , yeah .",
      "Marketing : i {vocalsound} it's not gonna add anything , okay .",
      "Project Manager : Okay , can we add in uh an attachment to closing feature ?",
      "User Interface : Okay .",
      "Project Manager : Can we think about that ? 'Cause if we're doing the kinetic thing and it's {disfmarker}",
      "Industrial Designer : Yeah .",
      "Marketing : Shouldn't we do some market research on that first before we add it in because I I personally {disfmarker}",
      "Project Manager : Well add it in to think about um",
      "Marketing : right , okay .",
      "Project Manager : because , where am I ? If it is the kinetic thing and it is small and it is portable and it is a different shape and the kinetic is something people don't do kind of {disfmarker}",
      "Industrial Designer : Yeah .",
      "Project Manager : we're doing something original and different um but if you wore it if it's something you could just clip on your pocket then you would have that less , you you wouldn't lose it so much .",
      "Industrial Designer : Yeah .",
      "Project Manager : But then maybe that's looking at someone who's just sitting on their own rather than",
      "Industrial Designer : Yeah .",
      "Project Manager : the eternal battle for control of the controls .",
      "Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}",
      "Marketing : It's not something that's come up in any of our uh focus groups and market research ,",
      "Project Manager : No .",
      "Marketing : it's not a thing that people are looking for",
      "Project Manager : Okay .",
      "User Interface : So {disfmarker}",
      "Marketing : when we threw it open to the field yeah .",
      "Industrial Designer : Okay .",
      "Marketing : But it's something to put on the side to think about maybe .",
      "Project Manager : Okay , right .",
      "Industrial Designer : Okay , well I'll move on .",
      "Project Manager : Mm-hmm .",
      "Industrial Designer : Um , my second part of my findings uh the mo most current remotes use this silicone uh P_C_B_ board which {disfmarker} pr printed circuit board , which basically has these contacts that are really close together and then when you press down on the rubber button , it'll connect the circuit and each each switch is connected to two uh different legs on the chip and so sends a different message and that then uh gets translated by the chip into a code and then it's fired out of this L_E_D_ in the sequence of l on and off bursts .",
      "Project Manager : What kind of things do we have to consider there ? Can we {disfmarker} what kind of size , does it come in varying sizes or is it just one size and we would have to fit the design of {disfmarker}",
      "Industrial Designer : Well well this {disfmarker} the thi the thing about is um they they can be as big or as small as you want them to be because you can you can print circuit board like that that it's it's simply spaced like that so you can have {disfmarker} fit the n the size of the nine buttons in . If you if you see how thin the tracks are , you could you could s you could put them virtually right next to each other and have a much smaller switch on each one ,",
      "Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Okay .",
      "Industrial Designer : if you if you wanted to but um the {disfmarker} there is an option to do to do it like that , or you could have some sort of array of switches which I'll speak about in the next bit",
      "Project Manager : Okay .",
      "Industrial Designer : so that {disfmarker} And then to {disfmarker} uh yeah , so to conserve battery life the remote should be in a standby mode no while not being used . Now what I was thinking about that was {disfmarker} 'cause sometimes when y when you have these things , they've got little lights on behind the buttons , so you can see what all the buttons are , like on a mobile phone , they do it more often than on a than on a T_V_ remote ,",
      "Project Manager : Mm-hmm .",
      "User Interface : Mm-hmm .",
      "Industrial Designer : but you could you could have lights behind the buttons and um after like five or ten seconds of not being used I'd have that turned off , if we decided to go for buttons that could light up .",
      "User Interface : Okay .",
      "Industrial Designer : Um , the case material , I've a been sent what the factory can actually give us , the {disfmarker} there's the plastic which I think we were gonna go for anyway as the main case {disfmarker} case housing",
      "Project Manager : Mm-hmm .",
      "Industrial Designer : and the the main problems with the {disfmarker} well you could go for wood but I think it would be a bit impractical . Titanium um very expensive just to process ,",
      "Project Manager : Mm .",
      "Industrial Designer : which to make it is expensive , and rubber , well you're saying that people like this uh spongy feel this year , so perhaps uh some something made of rubber ,",
      "Marketing : Mm .",
      "Industrial Designer : but I was thinking more of the buttons , because the buttons which they've they've said that they've they've put across are what is used in some stress ball manufacture and it's meant to be anti R_S_I_ .",
      "Marketing : Okay .",
      "Project Manager : Mm-hmm .",
      "Industrial Designer : I'm no I'm not sure how that would work because surely your fingers would still be moving over the short distances but that's what they said . Um the problem with the casing is that uh there's quite {vocalsound} um there's quite a few design restrictions that they've got on the shape of the case . If you go for titanium they can only do a standard box shape , whereas if you come to plastic they can they can be a little more {disfmarker} they can they can do sort of curved shapes . But whether whether or not {disfmarker} because we'd have it in two separate units",
      "User Interface : Second thing is {disfmarker}",
      "Project Manager : Hinged , yeah .",
      "Industrial Designer : for the flip phone .",
      "User Interface : yeah and second question is like , a mobile you can change the cover , you call it a skin or whatever .",
      "Industrial Designer : Yeah .",
      "User Interface : So in this case if you're looking at like a customer can change the colour like from green , parrot green to chilli red or something like that .",
      "Marketing : Mm .",
      "User Interface : So is that feature available in like uh titanium ,",
      "Industrial Designer : Yeah I th",
      "User Interface : or it's like only specific to plastic or {disfmarker}",
      "Industrial Designer : Uh . Yeah in in titanium I don't I don't think it would be available at all really , the ju just {disfmarker}",
      "Marketing : Mm-hmm .",
      "Industrial Designer : it w well you could make it available in the titanium , it was just it would be so expensive to buy a new case for it , because of the expense of how much titanium is is {disfmarker}",
      "User Interface : Mm-hmm .",
      "Industrial Designer : it's light and strong but I think it should be left for aircraft design rather than for for a remote .",
      "Marketing : It does mark quite easily too if you let it fall . I've got a mobile phone myself which is titanium and it does mark very easily if you drop it .",
      "Industrial Designer : Yeah , yeah .",
      "Marketing : I was just wondering if we make the basic mould out of plastic but have like a rubber cover that goes over ,",
      "Industrial Designer : Rubber , yeah .",
      "Marketing : that would give the spongy feel , that also allows us to kind of have different fasciae for the phone .",
      "Industrial Designer : And you can peel them off yeah .",
      "User Interface : Yeah .",
      "Project Manager : So instead of the fascia that comes off being plastic , the fascia that comes off would be the rubber ,",
      "Marketing : Like a rubber sleeve almost , yeah .",
      "User Interface : Something like {disfmarker}",
      "Project Manager : like those pens that you get with the grip , that you can you can pull that off .",
      "Industrial Designer : Yeah .",
      "User Interface : Alright .",
      "Industrial Designer : Yeah .",
      "Marketing : Mm .",
      "User Interface : That could be a good idea .",
      "Industrial Designer : Hmm .",
      "Marketing : Mm .",
      "User Interface : It could {disfmarker} it would be comfortable to hold on also .",
      "Project Manager : Okay . Mm .",
      "Industrial Designer : T",
      "Marketing : Very cheap way of changing the look of it and people can just buy a new one if they want to .",
      "Industrial Designer : Yeah .",
      "Project Manager : Well that's been really popular with mobile phones so I don't see why not .",
      "Marketing : Mm . Yeah .",
      "Industrial Designer : Also the {disfmarker}",
      "Project Manager : 'Kay .",
      "Industrial Designer : just just going back to the interface designs with the buttons , the {disfmarker} I kno we were planning to do some sort of touch screen .",
      "Project Manager : Mm-hmm .",
      "Industrial Designer : Now what I was saying before about instead of having {disfmarker} you could have just a bare P_C_B_ circuit board and I'm sure you could probably get it in different colours and so just by touching it with your finger it'd make the connection over {disfmarker} if you had them close enough , that would be one option . Um the second option th they offer rubber buttons , but I thought that an L_C_D_ type of screen {disfmarker} 'cause one they're incredibly thin um and don't take up much space , two they {disfmarker} you can have them in a sort of array and you can arrange the buttons on the screen in a sort of set thing and you could have them like a touch",
      "User Interface : Sorry I didn't get the last part , you're talking of {disfmarker}",
      "Industrial Designer : display . Uh what what {disfmarker}",
      "User Interface : Just what you said I I didn't get the uh meaning of it completely , you're saying like {disfmarker}",
      "Industrial Designer : Oh on the on the L_C_D_ screen you could {disfmarker} becau you could fit it {disfmarker}",
      "User Interface : Uh-huh .",
      "Industrial Designer : the problem with it basically is that it's flat and so you can't do lots of curve {disfmarker} curved things with it ,",
      "User Interface : Okay .",
      "Project Manager : Mm-hmm .",
      "Industrial Designer : but um you can {disfmarker} you wouldn't have {disfmarker} with the L_C_D_ you'd have the wires coming off , you wouldn't have that with the with the L_C_D_ , you'd only have that with the printed circuit board .",
      "Marketing : Mm .",
      "Industrial Designer : With {disfmarker} W also with the {disfmarker}",
      "Marketing : I don't {disfmarker} s sorry to interrupt , I don't see why the curved thing is a problem , if we for example had a shell , once we open that {disfmarker}",
      "Industrial Designer : Yeah .",
      "Project Manager : Oh it would be flat inside .",
      "Industrial Designer : You could have a flat screen inside , yeah ,",

      "Project Manager : Mm .",
      "Industrial Designer : but I'm just wondering whether we want an L_C_D_ screen inside .",
      "Marketing : Have I misunderstood you ?",
      "Industrial Designer : It wouldn't be like full colour , it would just be black and white ,",
      "Marketing : Mm-hmm .",
      "Industrial Designer : but there'd be touch touch buttons ,",
      "User Interface : 'Kay .",
      "Industrial Designer : so you wouldn't be pressing down on 'em , w or we could have rubber buttons which are made of this material which is anti-R_S_I_ .",
      "Project Manager : I think it would be good to have a contrast between , if the whole thing is gonna be this rubber thing it would be good to open it up and see something quite fancy looking inside .",

      "Industrial Designer : Is rubber . Mm .",
      "Marketing : Yeah .",
      "Project Manager : Now how would you distinguish , if you had it bare , how would you distinguish where you had to press , I mean {disfmarker}",
      "Industrial Designer : Yeah I hadn't I hadn't really thought of that to be honest .",
      "Project Manager : Uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound}",
      "Marketing : I just had another idea , I don't know if it helps with that , but just to do with the R_S_I_ . {vocalsound} Is it possible , just as an option , when we open it up , people can use their fingers to press the button , or we have inside like a small pointer thing when people want to {vocalsound} .",
      "Industrial Designer : Yeah you could , you could have some sort of stylus that you could pull out",
      "Project Manager : Like one of the palm pop thing .",

      "Marketing : Mm .",

      "Lynne Neagle AM : Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Children, Young People and Education Committee. We've received apologies for absence from Janet Finch-Saunders. I'd like to take this opportunity to welcome Suzy Davies to the committee, and to thank Mark Reckless and Darren Millar, who have left us, for their service and hard work as members of the committee. Can I ask whether there are any declarations of interest, please? No. Okay. We will move on then to our evidence session on our inquiry into the impact of Brexit on higher and further education. I'm very pleased to welcome Kirsty Williams, Cabinet Secretary for Education, and Eluned Morgan AM, Minister for Welsh Language and Lifelong Learning. Can I just ask you to introduce your officials for the record, please?",
      "Kirsty Williams AM : Bore da, Lynne, and thank you for the invitation to join you. Eluned and I are joined this morning by Huw Morris, who's the group director at SHELL\u2014skills, higher education and lifelong learning\u2014and Marie Knox, who is deputy director, overseeing European transition.",
      "Lynne Neagle AM : Okay, thank you very much, and thank you for coming. We'll go straight into questions, then, and the first questions are from Suzy Davies.",
      "Suzy Davies AM : Thank you. I'd like to ask you both, if that's okay, a little bit about preparedness. But if I could start with higher education, I understand that\u2014I don't know, it must be about 18 months ago now\u2014Ken Skates told another committee in this place that there had been nine sector analyses done. Presumably, one of those was HE, because of the\u2014well, Welsh Government had a presence, and still does, in Brussels, related to higher education. Apparently, those have now been superseded by work that's been done by Cardiff University. I don't know if you've got any comments on that research, or whether it's been brought to your attention yet.",
      "Kirsty Williams AM : Well, Suzy, following the vote, I was very keen that we work very closely with colleagues in higher education and further education, to get an understanding from on the ground about the potential impact. So, in terms of preparedness, we started that group in the September, and that work from that group, which includes both HE and FE, has been instrumental in helping the Government form its views, which were articulated in the Government's White Paper, 'Securing Wales' Future'. There has been ongoing work being done\u2014as the debate in London and Europe becomes a little bit more clear, then it becomes a little less clear, and then a little bit more clear, but, bearing in mind the difficulties of working in an ever-changing field, we have been refining those approaches. Each institution has been looking at their own institution, because, as you can imagine, although we have an overview of the sector, the challenges are very different for individual institutions\u2014so their exposure, for instance, to the number of European Union students that they have at their college, or the work that they might be doing with Horizon 2020, or their success\u2014and there has been considerable success in the HE field in securing structural funds for various projects\u2014the exposure and the potential impact of leaving the EU, in a 'no deal' or in a 'deal' scenario, is very, very different. But I don't know if, Huw, you want to talk any further.",
      "Suzy Davies AM : Maybe just to use the 'no deal' scenario is probably the easiest,\u00a0isn't it?",
      "Kirsty Williams AM : The 'no deal'?",
      "Suzy Davies AM : Well, yes, because that's the worst-case scenario, so let's look at that one.",
      "Huw Morris : As the Cabinet\u00a0Secretary mentioned, the higher education Brexit working group's\u00a0been meeting since September 2016 and has been looking at that in general. More recently, when the prospect of no deal became talked about, officials have been visiting individual institutions to talk to them about their preparedness for that. As you'll be aware, the funding for much of the activity is secured, we believe, even under a 'no deal' scenario, until December 2020; that's a letter we had from the Chief Secretary to the Treasury. I think the research you're referring to may be research that Cardiff University has been doing with the Bevan\u00a0Foundation and others. I know there's a report due to be launched later today. We have been doing our own research and looking at the impact on HE, FE and apprenticeship providers.",
      "Suzy Davies AM : Well, that's really helpful because my understanding was that this Cardiff University research\u00a0had superseded all those nine sector analyses.",
      "Huw Morris : That may be true for the economy brief. Certainly, there are published papers by Max Munday and a team at Cardiff University on the impact of Brexit on the Welsh economy, but for HE and FE and apprenticeship provision, it's as the Cabinet Secretary\u00a0outlined.",
      "Suzy Davies AM : So, are there any formal risk assessments that are available for us to scrutinise, for example? For HE and FE\u00a0for that matter.",
      "Kirsty Williams AM : Well, the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales have been doing some specific work; I can't comment on how wide they would want that to be shared. We have been doing some broad analysis, as I said, for the sector, looking at what we can do to mitigate the risk, bearing in mind that each institution is an autonomous institution, a principle that they guard really jealously, and rightly so. So, we have been, as Huw said, because the prospect of a 'no deal' has become, perhaps, more to the forefront, officers have been visiting each institution to try and make sure and to satisfy us, as people who fund part of their activity, that they have their own plans in place to deal with these scenarios. We continue to work alongside them to push the issues that we can help them with. So, for instance, we continue to work with officials in Westminster around Erasmus+ provision in a 'no deal' scenario, what a UK stand-alone project would look like, the impacts of a 'no deal' on Horizon 2020. So, we look at the broader picture and we are encouraging continually individual institutions to make sure that they themselves are looking at their specific needs within that.",
      "Suzy Davies AM : Well, if there is something that's shareable, I'm sure we'd be very pleased to see it\u2014",
      "Kirsty Williams AM : Anything that we've got\u2014",
      "Suzy Davies AM : \u2014particularly with FE, actually, because, of course, we haven't got a\u00a0HEFCW\u00a0for FE; you're doing that regulation yourself. I'd expect to see that type of work evidenced somewhere from within Welsh Government, and we would be able to see that then.",
      "Eluned Morgan AM : So, if I could just make some points on FE. We've been actively engaging with the FE sector. We've spoken to every one of the colleges about how they see things developing. I think it's quite a different response than what is going to be\u00a0happening in HE.",
      "Suzy Davies AM : Yes, because the student thing isn't such an issue, is it?",
      "Eluned Morgan AM : You've got to remember that the FE colleges are much more anchored within their\u00a0communities, they're much more localised, and so, for example, the number of EU students in these colleges is significantly lower. The number of staff in these colleges\u2014I think they've analysed that there are only about 71 people. So, we're keeping in touch with them and we're letting them know what we are being told in terms of the Home Office settled status and what we can do to protect those 71. But that's\u00a0a much bigger issue, I think, for higher education.",
      "Suzy Davies AM : What are they telling you about European social fund\u00a0funding, though, because, as you say, they're locally anchored\u2014the impact on FE of ESF funding is probably more significant than the issues we're talking about with higher education. How are you finding this out? Is this through one-to-one conversations?",
      "Eluned Morgan AM : We are engaging with them all, and, obviously, we're engaging with ColegauCymru, who've done their own analysis, and what we found, in particular, is that the real problems are probably in relation to ESF funding and apprenticeships. But what you've got to remember is that that link between apprenticeships and the local work community is absolutely crucial. So, if\u2014",
      "Suzy Davies AM : Yes, that's why I asked.",
      "Eluned Morgan AM : \u2014the economy nosedives, or if there's an issue that we see\u2014just the dislocation of companies in those areas as a result of Brexit\u2014then that will inevitably have an impact on the number of apprenticeships that will be on offer. So, it's those kinds of things, but at the moment I think it's worth pointing out that about \u00a315 million a year goes into the FE sector just in relation to apprenticeships.",
      "Suzy Davies AM : Can I just come back finally on that, before handing over? In both your areas of responsibility, there's going to be an impact on Welsh Government in how it responds to that, as well. Can you tell me a little bit about the European transition team, which I think is about building resilience within the Welsh Government to deal with the impacts of Brexit? Is that a formal arrangement you have with officials? I don't really know much about this team, but it seems to meet fortnightly to get Welsh Government ready for Brexit, so could you just give us some clues on this?",
      "Marie Knox : Yes, in terms of the European transition team, that's the central co-ordinating group that pulls together all the leads in each department who are pulling together the work on European transition. So, I attend that group in relation to higher education and further education, and, obviously, other representatives in terms of agriculture, transport, the economy, et cetera.",
      "Suzy Davies AM : It's great that you're on that group, but what does it actually do? That's the bit I wasn't sure about.",
      "Marie Knox : I guess it provides the governance structure for the Welsh Government as a whole in relation to European transition. So, individual departments do their own work, and the European transition team provides the governance structure, and, also, they lead on the discussions with the Department for Exiting the European Union, No.\u00a010, the Joint Ministerial Committee\u2014those kinds of ministerial arrangements.",
      "Suzy Davies AM : Thank you. I've had enough time, I think."

I congratulate you on that, but it does present us as a committee with a little bit of a problem, really, because, if we're told one thing a few months ago and then we're told something completely different today, you know, evidence\u2014we have to go on evidence that we've heard, and the evidence has changed now.",
      "Julie Morgan AM : I think, during the period since it was discussed on the committee, the work with the HMRC has helped highlight to us where we needed to go. So, I think we did learn a lot and it certainly has helped show to us where we think is the best place to go. I would like to pay tribute to the local authorities, because they've been great partners in this and they're very positive about moving forward keeping the work. And there's also a feeling that, because they are so much closer to the local public than HMRC is, they're able to build up links with families and help with some of these difficult issues. Because I'm sure many of you may have had individual cases\u2014I certainly have\u2014where there's been quite a lot of complexity about helping people fill in the forms and look at their eligibility. So, I say well done to the local authorities. And thanks to the HMRC, because we've had nothing but a very positive relationship with them.",

How much is it actually going to cost to change this system from being a temporary arrangement with local authorities to a permanent one? And how much more is it going to cost for the more flexible system that you have in mind? They're not going to do this for nothing. How much extra are you giving them, and will they use it for this? How are you ensuring it's used for this?",

That grant is ring-fenced to that purpose.",

We are now starting the detailed work to define the new system requirements so that we will have a single application process across Wales, moving forward. As part of that work, we'll need to consider the detailed costings, but our initial estimate suggests that it would be less than the cost proposed by HMRC.",

That doesn't mean that there's no administration. For example, with the foundation phase, which is universally available, there is an application process and there is an administrative function that sits alongside that. At this point in time, I couldn't give you any indication of\u2014",

      "The Chair : We'll now go to Ms. Kwan.",
      "Ms. Jenny Kwan (Vancouver East, NDP) : Thank you, Mr. Chair. Instead of providing a universal direct payment for all, the government has decided to implement a complicated program that leaves many people behind. A single parent with four school-age children lost her spousal and child support due to COVID-19. She pays taxes on her spousal income, but she is not eligible for CERB. The Minister of Employment said that she is looking into this gap. It has been weeks, and still no action. Will the Prime Minister step in and fix this gap so that the single parents and their children can get the support they need during this pandemic?",
      "Right Hon. Justin Trudeau : I'm happy, Mr. Chair, to correct the honourable member by pointing out that we actually moved in the most rapid and simplest possible way in providing income replacement to millions upon millions of Canadians who needed it through the Canada emergency response benefit. However, as the member points out, when one moves quickly and efficiently, there will be gaps, and that's why we've been working diligently to try to fill those gaps. We want to make sure that Canadians who need help, get it.",
      "Ms. Jenny Kwan : While the Minister of Employment has been aware of this for three weeks and says she is looking into it, there's still been no action. The truth of the matter is that single parents and their children who depend on spousal support and child maintenance are not getting support. Will the Prime Minister fix this gap?",
      "Right Hon. Justin Trudeau : We recognize the particular challenge faced by families, single parents and families with young children, which is why we increased the amount of the Canada child benefit to be able to support people in this particular moment. On top of that, we have looked to fill further gaps that have existed with the Canada emergency response benefit. Well over seven million Canadians have access to CERB, and we will continue to work with them",
      "Ms. Jenny Kwan : That does not replace spousal support and child maintenance, Prime Minister. Across the country there is no national standard to address the homelessness crisis amidst this pandemic, leaving communities at heightened risk from COVID-19. Canadians who are homeless or living in substandard housing have no access to bathroom facilities for basic hygiene. Those living in crowded SROs and shelters cannot practise social distancing. The problem is particularly acute in my riding in the Downtown Eastside. While the B.C. government has implemented an initiative to house some of the homeless population in empty hotels in the short term, support from the federal government is needed to secure permanent solutions post-COVID-19. Will the Prime Minister commit to providing matching funds and take the right to adequate housing seriously?",
      "Right Hon. Justin Trudeau : I know that the honourable member wouldn't want to inadvertently mislead the House. The fact is, the federal government almost immediately sent significant resources, hundreds of millions of dollars, to shelters across the country to enable them to create facilities, including renting new spaces, to be able to house homeless people without increasing the danger of the spread of COVID-19. I recognize there's always more to do, but as we demonstrated with our national housing strategy, we are serious about fighting homelessness and supporting vulnerable Canadians, and we will continue to do that.",
      "Ms. Jenny Kwan : The Prime Minister must know that the money the federal government sent is deficient. Many people still remain homeless, and they are at risk. Cutting chronic homelessness by 50% over the next decade is not good enough, and that is this Prime Minister's national housing strategy. Will the government stop just making empty promises and ensure that every Canadian has the right to housing? Will he top up the support for provinces to at least match their funds?",
      "Right Hon. Justin Trudeau : Mr. Chair, cutting chronic homelessness by 50% is an ambitious goal that no one else has ever been able to do as a government, and we are well on track for it. I would suggest that the member opposite not dismiss that as an empty promise, because we have demonstrated actions on it. I recognize there is more to do. There is always more to do. We will be there and continue to be there for vulnerable people, including homeless Canadians.",
      "Ms. Jenny Kwan : I would remind the Prime Minister that it was the federal Liberals who eliminated the national affordable housing program in 1993, so we have this homeless crisis today as a result of the Liberals. We in Vancouver East have the third-largest urban indigenous population in the country, yet we got less than 2% of the pandemic urban indigenous housing funding. They're overrepresented among the homeless population. Why?",
      "Right Hon. Justin Trudeau : Mr. Chair, we recognize there is more to do in supporting urban indigenous people. We have moved forward, both through the Minister of Indigenous Services and the Minister of Crown-Indigenous Relations, to address the challenges facing urban aboriginal populations. We will continue to work with them, recognizing that they are among the most vulnerable people in Canada who deserve the right support from all orders of government, and we will be there to support them increasingly in the coming years.",
      "The Chair : We'll now go on to Ms. Sgro.",
      "Hon. Judy A. Sgro (Humber RiverBlack Creek, Lib.) : Thank you very much, Mr. Chair. I appreciate the opportunity. I will be sharing my time with the member for KingsHants. Canadian seniors are worried about COVID-19. In my own riding of Humber RiverBlack Creek, 30% of the population are 65 or older. We know they are one of the highest risk populations. During this time, their costs have gone up. They have had to spend extra on medication and grocery delivery, as many cannot leave their homes. I have also heard of many seniors who are facing extra dispensing fees. These costs all add up, and many seniors were already carefully budgeting before the pandemic. It is so important that our government be there to support them. Can the minister please tell us what our government is doing to ensure that vulnerable seniors get the support they need during this very difficult time?",
      "The Chair : The honourable minister.",
      "Hon. Deb Schulte : My colleague is right. Seniors have faced increased costs due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and our government today has responded to that with additional action. We announced a one-time, tax-free payment of $300 for seniors eligible for OAS and an additional $200 for seniors eligible for GIS. This means there will be up to $500 for the most vulnerable seniors to help them with their financial security to get through this challenging time. Beyond this, we announced $20 million to expand the new horizons for seniors program to kick-start initiatives and services that will help seniorsfor example, to get grocery deliveries right to their door and to stay connected. We've worked tirelessly on this as well as on other recent measures like the GST credit to help the most vulnerable seniors. Thank you to my colleague for her advocacy.",
      "The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton (Simcoe North, CPC)) : You have 30 seconds left, Ms. Sgro. Go ahead with a short question and a response.",
      "Hon. Judy A. Sgro : Thank you very much, Mr. Chair. I want to applaud the minister for that work. I know she's been working extremely hard to make sure that we get some additional announcements over and above all of the ones we have already made, so congratulations. Keep up the work. You know there is lots more we want to do.",
      "The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton) : Please give a short response. Go ahead.",
      "Hon. Deb Schulte : Thank you very much to my honourable colleague for her advocacy. Thanks for everyone's advocacy. Seniors across the country have been communicating with us and letting us know their needs, and we have been responding.",
      "The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton) : Continuing with questions, we'll go to the honourable member for SaskatoonUniversity, Mr. Tochor.",
      "Mr. Corey Tochor (SaskatoonUniversity, CPC) : Good afternoon, everybody. With respect to entering Canada, does the government consider spousal reunification as essential travel, yes or no?",
      "The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton) : The honourable minister.",
      "Hon. Bill Blair : The CBSA has exercised the appropriate discretion in determining when a non-Canadian citizen, who has no status in Canada, attempts to enter the country for any consideration considered non-essential. They are turned back because we have restrictions in place for non-essential travel.",
      "Mr. Corey Tochor : Respectfully to the minister, you're letting down Canadians. People are being stranded, and you need to do better as a government.  Changing gears a little, all Canadians would agree, or can agree, that the Prime Minister requires suitable accommodation. Why did the government simply not tell Canadians that the Harrington cottage needed to be rebuilt and massively expanded?",
      "The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton) : I would ask the honourable members to direct their questions through the chair. The honourable minister.",
      "Hon. Anita Anand : The NCC is an independent Crown corporation. It recognizes the importance of the official residences it has jurisdiction over. The work at Harrington Lake is part of a broader program to preserve and maintain and restore all official residences under NCC management, and we will support the NCC in its important work.",
      "Mr. Corey Tochor : Was there something in particular that this government did not want Canadians to know about the cottage, or is secrecy all this government knows how to do?",
      "Hon. Anita Anand : Mr. Chair, this information was and has been public since 2018. There is no effort to hide any information from the public in this regard.",
      "Mr. Corey Tochor : Respectfully, Canadians feel misled on this, and we're not clear on what the expenses were, how large an expansion it was",
      "The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton) : Go ahead, the honourable government House leader.",
      "Hon. Pablo Rodriguez : On a point of order, Mr. Chair, I believe this has absolutely nothing to do with the pandemic, so the questions are out of order, in my opinion. Thank you.",
      "The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton) : I thank the honourable government House leader for his comment. Certainly the scope of the special committee on the COVID-19 pandemic does expect and anticipate that the subject matter will be related to the matter at hand, so I would ask honourable members to continue to keep within those bounds. Of course, members will also know that we're unable to gauge that until members have spoken, so I would ask members to keep on subject. Let's go back to Mr. Tochor to finish his question, and we have about two minutes remaining in this spot.",
      "Mr. Corey Tochor : Yes, thank you, Chair. The point I was making was about transparency or lack of transparency that is hurting our efforts with COVID-19. Changing gears onto CERB, who came up with the number for CERB? Why is it $2,000? A senior gets $1,200, people with disabilities get $1,600, and now we've added another ad hoc program on top of those. I'd like to know a little more about how and who came up with those unique numbers.",
      "The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton) : The honourable minister.",
      "Hon. Carla Qualtrough : Working collaboratively between ESDC and the Department of Finance, we determined that that would be an appropriate amount, based on what workers were earning and what we anticipated they would need to live on, and what we anticipated they would be losing by way of employment income.",
      "The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton) : Your last question, Mr. Tochor.",
      "Mr. Corey Tochor : I have a really quick question, which I've heard in my office, on charities and non-profits that do not have their own payroll number and are ineligible for the wage subsidy. Does the Prime Minister have a program fix coming so that charities and non-profits can receive the wage subsidy?",
      "The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton) : The honourable minister.",
      "Hon. Ahmed Hussen : Mr. Chair, we understand the important role that charities and non-profits are playing to help vulnerable Canadians at this difficult time. We have announced supports in the amount of $350 million to ensure that not only do they continue that great work, but also expand it to serve the most vulnerable to get through the COVID-19 pandemic."

Mr. Gabriel Ste-Marie asked that they be stricter with banks and large multinationals, because some registered their activities in a tax haven so as not to pay their taxes in Canada and also benefit from government support. Right Hon. Justin Trudeau said that the priority was to help workers as soon as possible and although from the beginning the payment of taxes by companies was requested as a requirement to access financing, now they were evaluating each one, to ensure that Be transparent about your finances before giving them the loan, as the government did not tolerate tax evasion and tax avoidance.",

      "The Chair : We'll now proceed to questioning ministers. The first question will go to Mr. Albas.",
      "Mr. Dan Albas (Central OkanaganSimilkameenNicola, CPC) : Thank you, Mr. Chair. Today we've learned that federal workers have been told to ignore obvious signs of fraud when it comes to applying for government benefits. Can the Prime Minister confirm that 200,000 applications have been flagged as potentially fraudulent?",
      "Right Hon. Justin Trudeau (Prime Minister) : Thank you, Mr. Chair. Our priority from the beginning has been to make sure that Canadians get the support they need. We moved very quickly to get the Canada emergency response benefit out, to get the wage subsidy out and to help Canadians in this unprecedented situation. We recognize there will be challenges, and we are going to work through those challenges. Our priority every step of the way was to make sure we helped as many Canadians as possible.",
      "Mr. Dan Albas : Mr. Chair, can the Prime Minister confirm that the instruction has been given to federal employees to ignore these 200,000 applications being flagged as potentially fraudulent? This is important.",
      "Right Hon. Justin Trudeau : Our focus has been on helping as many people as we possible can. Our decision from the very beginning was to get the help out to people and figure out, with retroactive action if necessary, where and when there may have been fraudulent use. Our priority was getting that help out.",
      "Mr. Dan Albas : Mr. Chair, this came from a memo issued by a deputy minister. Did the minister's office or the Prime Minister sign off on this memo?",
      "Right Hon. Justin Trudeau : Again, in this unprecedented situation, our focus has been on helping as many people as possible, as quickly as possible. Other parties might have made a different choice had they been in government, but our focus was getting help to people when they needed it as quickly as possible and cleaning it up afterwards.",
      "Mr. Dan Albas : Mr. Chair, I asked a very simple question. Did the Prime Minister or his minister sign off on this memo that was issued by the deputy minister, yes or no?",
      "Right Hon. Justin Trudeau : Mr. Chair, we have been focused entirely on getting help to Canadians when they need it, and that has meant that yes, there will be things we will need to clean up after the fact and work to fix, but getting that help into Canadians' pockets during this pandemic was our priority.",
      "Mr. Dan Albas : I'm asking the Prime Minister to show some accountability. Did he or his office sign off on this memo?",
      "Right Hon. Justin Trudeau : Mr. Chair, my office and I have been absolutely focused on getting the necessary help to Canadians. Perhaps, as Mr. Albas points out, other parties would have been slower to get the money out. We were flowing money to people who needed it.",
      "Mr. Dan Albas : Mr. Chair, the question was quite simple. Obviously the Prime Minister doesn't seem comfortable with the answer. Will he at least then commit to investigating every individual case of fraud, or will he write them off, as the story said?",
      "Right Hon. Justin Trudeau : Mr. Chair, in this unprecedented situation Canadians have lost their jobs; they've lost their paycheques; they don't know how they're going to be able to support their loved ones and pay for their groceries. We made a decision as a country that we would be there for them and that has been and will continue to be our priority.",
      "Mr. Dan Albas : Mr. Chair, the Prime Minister can leave the cottage talk for the cottage. We're asking a very simple question here. Will he commit as a government to enforce the rule of law and to enforce the attestation that says that if someone commits fraud, the fraud will be pursued?",
      "Right Hon. Justin Trudeau : My commitment as Prime Minister and as a government is to support and protect Canadians. That is what we are doing by giving them the support they need through this unprecedented situation. Perhaps other parties don't think it's important to support Canadians. We will keep focused on supporting Canadians.",
      "Mr. Dan Albas : That's not what I'm asking here, Mr. Chair. The Conservatives supported the legislation that allowed those supports to go through. What we are asking about is fraud. All along we've been told fraud would be detected through audits after the fact, and we expect that to happen. Can the Prime Minister at least confirm that this will happen?",
      "Right Hon. Justin Trudeau : When we made the determination that we needed to move quickly to help Canadians, we knew there would be a need to clean up after the fact, to go after fraudulent cases. We will do that. Our priority now and in the coming months is to ensure Canadians get the support they need, and our economy comes roaring back. That's what we're focused on.",
      "The Chair : We'll now continue with Mr.Ste-Marie.",
      "Mr. Gabriel Ste-Marie (Joliette, BQ) : Mr.Chair, yesterday, the Prime Minister announced the large employer emergency financing facility. That's good. What's even better is that he announced that the loans would be tied to conditions. One of those conditions forces companies not to resort to tax evasion or tax avoidance through tax havens. Excellent! Unfortunately, I quickly became disillusioned because it is more about abusive tax evasion and avoidance. Basically, we're talking about fraudsters. There are no conditions that would allow us to tighten the screws on profiteers. Companies that legally take advantage of tax havens to avoid paying their taxes will have access to the large employer emergency financing facility. Why does the Prime Minister continue to support the profiteers?",
      "Right Hon. Justin Trudeau : Mr.Chair, we will always be there to counter tax evasion and tax avoidance. It's a priority of our government. There is no tolerance for tax evasion and tax avoidance. In the current situation, our priority is to help workers across the country who could lose their jobs or who have lost their jobs. That's why we are introducing measures that support workers, who will continue to be our priority.",
      "Mr. Gabriel Ste-Marie : Mr.Chair, I'm delighted to hear the Prime Minister say that there's no tolerance for tax avoidance. The problem is that his remarks don't reflect reality. Tax avoidance is the legal use of tax havens. The five big Bay Street banks benefit from this, as do the big multinationals. It's time to tighten the screws on these companies. They have to pay their share. Will the Prime Minister and his government outlaw what is immoral?",
      "Right Hon. Justin Trudeau : Mr.Chair, when we announced the large employer emergency funding facility, we recognized that those who wanted to receive tax dollars had to have paid their fair share of taxes. That's why we're putting in place measures to carefully assess the tax structures of these businesses before we loan money to them.",
      "Mr. Gabriel Ste-Marie : Mr.Chair, sometimes a bank will relocate its most profitable activities carried out in Canada and register them in a subsidiary in the Bahamas, Barbados or another tax haven. Does the Prime Minister consider this bank to be paying its fair share of taxes in Canada?",
      "Right Hon. Justin Trudeau : Mr.Chair, we will assess applications for the large employer emergency funding facility on a case-by-case basis. We don't expect the big banks to need these funds. Before we provide any money, we're going to make sure that whoever wants to access these funds is transparent about how the money is being managed, including internationally.",
      "Mr. Gabriel Ste-Marie : Mr.Chair, I'll change the subject now. Consumers are paying more and more with their credit cards, which allows contactless payments in shops, not to mention online shopping. This benefits Visa and Mastercard, which charge appallingly high user fees, known as interchange fees. These are almost 10times higher than in Europe and Australia, and it costs our merchants a fortune. Can the Prime Minister follow the example of Europe and Australia by capping interchange fees at0.3%?",
      "Right Hon. Justin Trudeau : Mr.Chair, we are always looking for ways to reduce costs for consumers. We have worked with the big banks and the financial industry to ensure that people who need it have access to the help they need. We're reassessing how we can lower costs for consumers. Right now, we're sending money to consumers across the country who need it to get through this crisis. That's what we'll continue to focus on.",
      "Mr. Gabriel Ste-Marie : Mr.Chair, the question doesn't concern consumers, but merchants. A credit card company, such as Visa and Mastercard, that charges a fee of 2.5%to3% per transaction undermines the merchant's profit margin and gets richer at the expense of consumers. I invite the Prime Minister to follow the example of Europe and Australia by capping these fees at0.3%.",
      "Right Hon. Justin Trudeau : Mr.Chair, we continue to work with financial institutions and the big banks to help consumers during this exceptional and difficult situation. Of course, there are some things we can look at over the longer term as well.",
      "The Chair : Ms. Bergen.",
      "Hon. Candice Bergen (PortageLisgar, CPC) : Thank you very much, Mr. Chair. Mr. Chair, I'm hearing in my riding of PortageLisgar that individuals who are dealing with Service Canada through the mail are experiencing delays. It seems that the mail that's going to Service Canada has not been opened. In fact, one of my constituents sent documents, including a doctor's note, two months ago on March 12 and is now being told that she must resend them because they've never been opened. Can the government tell us whether this is a widespread problem, and how are they dealing with unopened mail at Service Canada?",
      "The Chair : The honourable minister.",
      "Hon. Ahmed Hussen (Minister of Families, Children and Social Development) : Mr. Chair, I want to assure the honourable member that we are doing everything that we can in Service Canada to meet the expectations of Canadians. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have had unprecedented volumes, but we have redeployed thousands of staff to front-line services by phone and by other means. We had to close a number of the centres because of COVID-19 concerns and the safety and well-being of Canadians.",
      "Hon. Candice Bergen : Is the minister aware whether this is a widespread problem? Is this happening rarely, or frequently? I'm hearing about it. I know, from many MPs, we are at the front lines of dealing with and helping constituents who are not only wanting to get support but also are trying to get programs unrelated to COVID-19. Is unopened mail a widespread problem at Service Canada?",
      "Hon. Ahmed Hussen : Mr. Chair, I'm happy to look into the particular case that the honourable member brings up. I am not aware of unopened mail being a widespread issue. I'm happy to work with the honourable member to see what happened in this individual case.",
      "Hon. Candice Bergen : Thanks very much. Mr. Chair, the Iver Johnson single-shot rifle is a standard farm gun used by many farmers in my riding, in fact, passed down from generation to generation in some cases. Why are the Liberals making this gun illegal? What's the purpose of banning this particular farm rifle?",
      "The Chair : The honourable minister.",
      "Hon. Bill Blair (Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness) : Thank you very much, Mr. Chair. I just wish to advise the member that we worked very closely with the Canadian firearms program, with law enforcement and with their firearms verification to identify the makes, models and variants of nine rifles, all of which had in their earliest provenance a design for military use, for soldiers to use in combat. Those are the weapons that have been",
      "The Chair : We'll now go back to Ms. Bergen.",
      "Hon. Candice Bergen : I would challenge the minister on that. I do not believe that he has been consulting with front-line officers. We're hearing from front-line officers that they are concerned about gangs, drug dealers and illegal weapons being smuggled across the border. They are not concerned with these types of farm rifles that are being used by our farmers and, in some cases, hunters. These are specifically used for hunting. So, Mr. Chair, we'd like to see the evidence on why the Liberals are once again targeting law-abiding Canadians, ignoring gangsters and drug dealers. Why are they banning the Iver Johnson?",
      "Hon. Bill Blair : It's a great opportunity, I think, when the member opposite says what the police are saying. Let's hear what the police are saying. The Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police declared that military assault rifles were produced for the sole purpose of killing people in large numbers and urged the government to enact legislation to ban all military assault rifles, except for law enforcement and military purposes. The Ontario police leaders said that they support a prohibition on all military-designed rifles. They said, In our view, these weapons have no place in our communities and should be reserved for use by Canada's military and law enforcement.",
      "The Chair : Ms. Bergen, we have about 50 seconds left.",
      "Hon. Candice Bergen : Mr. Chair, we've seen this before, where the Liberals introduced a long-gun registry that cost billions of dollars and did absolutely nothing to stop violent crimes. This is a repeat of what the Liberals have done before. Is the minister saying that the Iver Johnson that farmers use is an assault rifle?",
      "Hon. Bill Blair : Actually, what I'm saying, and what our regulations say very clearly, is that weapons that were designed not for hunting and not for sport purposes but for soldiers to use in combat to kill other soldiers have no place in Canadian society. I would also advise the member that any Canadian killed by gun violence is one too many. We have far too many tragedies where these types of weapons have been used to kill Canadians."

      "Industrial Designer : but it {disfmarker} you're {disfmarker} the remote also can act as a recharger . So then you can choose , you have every decision . Know what I mean ?",

      "Marketing : Hmm . Yeah yeah .",
      "Project Manager : I think it's uh it's a pretty good idea to have uh like sort of a {disfmarker} maybe a base station that you put on the T_V_ . Could be flat , you could insert your uh remote into it .",

      "Marketing : Yeah , that's g",

      "Industrial Designer : you don't need basic station . Yes .",
      "Project Manager : or {disfmarker} So you could put that on a T_V_ for example .",

      "Industrial Designer : Yeah .",

      "Marketing : Yeah .",

      "Marketing : But f hmm .",
      "Industrial Designer : Yes .",
      "Project Manager : um and {disfmarker} Yeah , we have to {disfmarker} either that or make it integrated with a with a docking station .",
      "Industrial Designer : Hmm . Yeah . Exactly . I think this is a brilliant product .",
      "Project Manager : {vocalsound} I think it would be good actually .",

      "Project Manager : Maybe {disfmarker} yeah ,",

      "Nicola Edwards : They wouldn't have to do the eligibility checks, but they would still have to make payments to the childcare providers and make sure they were paying for the right number of hours in respect of each child. So, parents would still need to tell them where their child was going, and there would still need to be some work alongside that.",
      "Lynne Neagle AM : Okay. Si\u00e2n, do you want to ask about the Welsh language?",
      "Sian Gwenllian AM : I think we've\u2014. I'm happy with that.",
      "Lynne Neagle AM : Really\u2014?",
      "Sian Gwenllian AM : I don't think that that was the real reason why the change happened.",
      "Julie Morgan AM : One of the reasons.",
      "Lynne Neagle AM : Nevertheless, the committee was given very concrete assurances that the Welsh language side of this was going to be covered off. Have you got anything that you want to add on that? Obviously, for us as a committee, we believe what we're told when we are given assurances. So, that's quite concerning for us, really, that that suddenly then became an issue, when both HMRC and the Minister at the time told us that this wasn't going to be a problem.",
      "Nicola Edwards : So, I think it's the point that I was talking about earlier. There's a difference between a bilingual service in the context of what HMRC understood that to be, in the context of their scheme, and the very detail of the standards when they got into their IT systems.",
      "Lynne Neagle AM : Shouldn't that have been something that was worked out at the beginning?",
      "Nicola Edwards : Possibly, but they did need to do quite detailed work, not just into their own IT systems, but the feed-in systems from the Home Office, the Department for Work and Pensions and the Post Office as well, to understand the full complexity of how the standards would comply across all of that. They do provide a bilingual service. It was just some of the specific details of the requirements placed on the Welsh Ministers, because it is the Welsh Ministers' standards that they would need to deliver against that they were struggling with.",
      "Lynne Neagle AM : Right, okay.",
      "Sian Gwenllian AM : Yes, but those standards were there right from the very beginning.",
      "Lynne Neagle AM : I think that the committee would feel that that should have been bottomed out at the beginning, really.",
      "Sian Gwenllian AM : Nothing has changed in terms of the standards.",
      "Lynne Neagle AM : Okay, just before we move on to Flying Start, can I just ask: the Minister mentioned a longer term review of the childcare offer. Are you able to give us any indication of when that will report, please?",
      "Julie Morgan AM : Would we have any idea?",
      "Nicola Edwards : We haven't set out a definitive timescale on that as of yet because we've been focusing very much on getting the review in terms of training, education and on the cusp of returning to work up and running. But sometime next year.",
      "Lynne Neagle AM : Okay. So, it will report sometime next year.",
      "Nicola Edwards : Yes.",
      "Lynne Neagle AM : Okay, thank you. We'll move on now to Flying Start and questions from Suzy Davies.",
      "Suzy Davies AM : Thank you, Chair. Can I just begin by asking you how you respond to the assertion that children from the most disadvantaged backgrounds do better in a mixed socioeconomic environment than in a targeted environment?",
      "Julie Morgan AM : I think that's what Flying Start does, isn't it? Yes, I would have thought that was likely.",
      "Suzy Davies AM : Well, the reason I'm asking you that, of course, is because this committee has suggested, perhaps, changes to the outreach system to target more disadvantaged children, and not necessarily capture people who happen to be in a geographic area.",
      "Julie Morgan AM : So, you're saying that you feel that a universal offer in certain areas is not advantageous to\u2014",
      "Suzy Davies AM : Well, I'm asking you, really. If it's the case that we're only going after disadvantaged children, which would take very precise targeting\u2014",
      "Julie Morgan AM : I'm not only going after disadvantaged children. I feel that we should be offering something for all children, and our considerations are for all children. The reason we've targeted Flying Start is because it would be great if we had enough money to have Flying Start throughout the whole of Wales, but we just don't have that sort of money. Because I think Flying Start has proved to be a great\u2014very successful.",
      "Suzy Davies AM : I'm going to ask you a few more questions on that. Because just in response to this committee's 2018 report, you did say that: 'defined geographical targeting of Flying Start support will be considered as part of the Welsh Government\u2019s work on the Early Years system.' That suggests you still have geographic targeting in mind. So, if you're looking at a very mixed source of economic experience for children, what are the geographic boundaries you're considering?",
      "Julie Morgan AM : At the moment, Flying Start can go beyond the geographical boundaries, with the extension\u2014",
      "Suzy Davies AM : With limits, yes.",
      "Julie Morgan AM : Yes. I think they can use 10 per cent of their income to go beyond the geographical boundaries, and many of them have done that. But, obviously, there are four elements to Flying Start, and only those geographical areas have got the four elements, but there could be the opportunity of extending some of that beyond the Flying Start geographical areas. We're looking at this.",
      "Suzy Davies AM : I accept what you say about the current system\u2014",
      "Julie Morgan AM : I believe it's much more\u2014. I believe very strongly in having a universal system, where everybody is able to access it.",
      "Suzy Davies AM : I appreciate that as well. But, obviously, there are huge cost implications for that\u2014unless you're giving us some insight into what you're going to say next week, I don't know. But actually, defining anything geographically, which now seems to be fairly arbitrary, because it's not targeted purely at disadvantaged children\u2014on what basis are we choosing the geographic areas we are choosing at the moment?",
      "Julie Morgan AM : Well, they're chosen then because of the benefit take-up in those particular areas. So, it's reaching some of the poorest children, but not all of the poorest children, but it's reaching the poorest children in a way that is not stigmatising, and where the services are open to everybody, and I think that's very important.",
      "Suzy Davies AM : Okay. Well, having established that, we have fairly recent research here that a third of children living in poverty in Wales are already falling behind at the age of five\u2014that suggests that two thirds of them aren't, but it's still a very worrying statistic. Not all children live in Flying Start areas; how are you going to reach that third who, even at such an early age, are already falling behind? How many of them are in Flying Start areas?",
      "Julie Morgan AM : I think the actual number of children in poverty, the most disadvantaged that we reach through the Flying Start areas\u2014I think it's about 46 per cent. Is that\u2014? Do you know the actual percentage?",
      "Suzy Davies AM : It's about a quarter of total children are in there, but\u2014",
      "Jo-Anne Daniels : So, just to give you a few of the numbers, there are just over 36,000 children benefiting from Flying Start services. That equates to about 23 per cent of children, overall, in Wales. And because of the nature of the benefit take-up data, and because we don't assess eligibility within a Flying Start area, we can't be absolutely certain how many children within a Flying Start area are actually in poverty. So, it's an estimate, and it's a range, and the range is that around 45 per cent of children in Flying Start areas would be in poverty.FootnoteLink",
      "Suzy Davies AM : Well, that's interesting. I would have expected it to be much higher than that, particularly if the geographic areas had been targeted on benefit claims, effectively. Are you disappointed that the proportion is\u2014basically, 55 per cent of those children aren't living in poverty. That's what you're saying, isn't it?",
      "Jo-Anne Daniels : Well, I'd offer two observations. One: the nature of poverty in Wales is actually, generally, more dispersed than perhaps sometimes is appreciated. Yes, we have very concentrated areas of\u2014",
      "Suzy Davies AM : Well, actually, we do appreciate it, which is why we're asking this question. [Laughter.]",
      "Jo-Anne Daniels : Okay. So that's one issue to think about. Sorry, I've lost my train of thought now, in terms of the second\u2014oh, sorry: whether you're in or out of poverty is, in one sense, very black/white. But in reality of course\u2014in terms of the income definition, it's very black/white. But, of course, there will be a large number of people who are just above, but also families who move in and out, so it's quite a transient population in some senses, in terms of people having incomes that aren't stable, people having jobs that go with that that aren't stable. So, at any one point in time, you're only sort of capturing a snapshot of what's happening. In reality, it's a bit more complex than that.",
      "Suzy Davies AM : I accept that. I mentioned a third of children living in poverty had fallen behind at five; by the age of 14, half that number is still falling behind, so something has happened between that third and that half to improve the life chances of those individual children or young people. Is that attributable to Flying Start? Can you say that candidly? Or is it a happy coincidence, where there could be some causation, but we can\u2019t prove it?",
      "Jo-Anne Daniels : We certainly think that Flying Start is making a positive impact, both on the point at which children go to school, and then subsequently. And I think as the committee knows, we\u2019ve been working with the SAIL\u2014secure anonymised information linkage\u2014and the databank there to look at how we can do longitudinal studies to track children\u2019s progress, to look at the extent to which outcomes are effected by Flying Start interventions.",
      "Suzy Davies AM : We probably don't have time for this level of detail today, but half of those children are still behind at the age of 14. So, I'd be curious to know if there's any immediate plans to help them catch up or make sure that their successors don't fall into the same position, the same trap. Have you got anything high level that you can mention at this stage?",
      "Julie Morgan AM : Just in terms of what we\u2019re thinking of doing with Flying Start\u2014. The key thing about Flying Start is the collaborative way that it works with the health visitors and all the speech and language therapists and childcare, and we\u2019re looking at ways of trying to get some of those elements to reach a wider group. And as I said, we talked about earlier the eight earlier years transformation pathfinders that we talked about in the local authorities\u2014we talked about that earlier\u2014so, that\u2019s where we\u2019re going to look at Flying Start and how we can try to make it more accessible to more children. So, we do want to extend the benefits of Flying Start. We do want to make it available to more children, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re looking at. And we\u2019re looking at that in those eight pathfinder areas. And you'll have to wait to see what we come up with\u2014",
      "Suzy Davies AM : No, no\u2014we'll ask you more about that in due course. Actually, that job would be an awful lot easier if you knew how many children within Flying Start areas were taking up all four elements. Why don't you know that? Why is that data not collected?",
      "Julie Morgan AM : Do we know why?",
      "Jo-Anne Daniels : So, the approach that we\u2019ve taken to evaluation in Flying Start\u2014. The committee will have seen the various evaluation reports that have been published, and I know that you\u2019re familiar with the work that, as I say, we\u2019ve been doing with SAIL. We\u2019re currently focusing on individual data collection, and through that we want to be able to report on levels of engagement, but also outcomes for children. We\u2019ve been piloting that new approach in six local authorities. We hope to be able to extend that, and we hope to be able to provide more evidence about the interventions and the impact that they then achieve.",
      "Suzy Davies AM : Okay. All right. Because, to be honest, I would want to know if a child\u2019s chances have improved primarily because they\u2019re getting good-quality childcare or primarily because their parents are taking up parenting courses. There\u2019s got to be some indication somewhere in here about which of these four elements is making the greatest difference.",
      "Jo-Anne Daniels : I would just caution in terms of expectations. It will always be quite difficult to definitively provide answers to that, because many parents will be taking these things up in combination. So, disentangling which has had the effect is, obviously, quite tricky\u2014in particular, all parents will be getting the enhanced health visiting. Not every parent will take up parenting support, not every child will need speech and language help, so\u2014",
      "Suzy Davies AM : And that's why we need to know who is.",
      "Jo-Anne Daniels : Disentangling what's helped and what hasn't I think will always be quite a difficult thing to do.",
      "Suzy Davies AM : But it would also be helpful to know which combinations work best as well. Just on the final point from me\u2014yes, 88 per cent of Flying Start's childcare offers were taken up, but we've had some local authorities where the take-up has dropped dramatically. I think Denbighshire was down a fair bit, wasn't it, and Ceredigion, I think, had had a poor take-up. Have you got any indication why? I'm thinking of Denbighshire particularly, where there is a tradition\u2014taking up third-party childcare is cultural there, whereas in Ceredigion,\u00a0for example, there are far fewer places available in the first place and less of a tradition of children taking up childcare. But what's happened in Denbighshire?",
      "Julie Morgan AM : I think there are a number of different reasons why parents do decide not to use a facility, and, obviously, that always exists, but each local authority has a Flying Start account manager in place to support them in the delivery of the programme and the account management activities, and there are formal account meetings that look at this sort of thing once a year\u2014",
      "Suzy Davies AM : So, what have they told you?",
      "Julie Morgan AM : \u2014and these meetings will take place in November 2019. That's when the specific delivery issues will be discussed in depth, so that's when we'll find out what has happened and why there may have been a drop.",
      "Suzy Davies AM : Can I just ask about the timing of that? Because if you already know that there's a 6 per cent drop, why will it take the best part of a year to\u2014well, November's only next month, to be fair, now, but why will it take that length of time to establish why there's a drop? You'd have thought if you'd seen a trend like that\u2014",
      "Julie Morgan AM : Obviously, they meet at certain times and they will assess what's happened. That seems quite normal to me.",
      "Suzy Davies AM : Okay, but we'll get a note on that, is it? It's just that they knew this six months ago.",
      "Julie Morgan AM : In November, we'll have more information about this, so we can let you have information about that.",
      "Suzy Davies AM : That would be really helpful, just for\u2014. I'm sure constituents in Denbighshire will want to know about that. And then finally from me, Chair, if I may, Flying Start beneficiaries\u2014it's got a specific explanation of what a Flying Start beneficiary is, but I think, particularly in view of the evidence we've heard on this committee about parental support in connection with the removal of the defence of reasonable chastisement, for example, this committee is very concerned about what's out there in terms of parental support. Eighteen per cent of Flying Start beneficiaries have parents attending the informal parenting courses; that's 18 per cent, that's not very high. Any idea about what you might be able to do to encourage take-up or is that very locally decided?",
      "Lynne Neagle AM : If I can add to that, obviously, somebody only has to attend one course\u2014we've got no way of knowing whether parents are completing the whole of a course, really.",
      "Julie Morgan AM : Obviously, the offer is there for parents to take up the parenting courses, and there are four elements to Flying Start, and maybe some of the parents don't feel that they want to or need to. I don't think we've got any more evidence on that for take-up\u2014",
      "Suzy Davies AM : Well, the reach of this is going to be important, because we need the reassurance on the back of the legislation that is going through at the moment.",
      "Julie Morgan AM : Absolutely, yes.",
      "Jo-Anne Daniels : Parenting courses are, of course, one aspect of parenting support, but not the only one, and they'll be appropriate for a lot of parents, but for some not. What all parents do get at an enhanced level in Flying Start is the support of the health visitor, so the health visitor is, in effect, providing a significant amount of support for parenting. Now, that can be practical things like weaning or potty training et cetera, but, actually, it's also about managing a child's behaviour, managing how a parent develops that bonding and that attachment with their child. So, the role of the health visitor in supporting a parent to be a parent is absolutely critical, and every parent in Flying Start areas will be getting that enhanced level of support. Of course, it's not just in Flying Start areas now, because with the Healthy Child Wales programme, the universal programme of health visiting visits, we have a much more consistent and standardised set of visits and engagements with parents that cover a lot of these areas. In addition, I'd also add that when parents use the childcare in Flying Start, or childcare generally outside of Flying Start areas, there is often a lot of working between the childcare setting and the parent over parenting\u2014again, managing a child's behaviour, managing any issues that the childcare worker thinks are emerging in terms of whether it's eating or, again, toileting. So, parenting courses are important, but it's really essential that we see those in the broader context of the different ways in which lots of professionals interact with parents, providing them with advice, guidance and support, and actually what works for parents in terms of how they take on board some of that advice and that help. Sometimes a formal course is quite off-putting for parents, but the sort of quiet word, the top tips, the advice that a friendly professional gives can be very, very impactful.",
      "Suzy Davies AM : That's a really helpful answer. It does raise, unfortunately, another question about whether a health visitor in those circumstances might find themselves in a difficult position if they're dealing with a parent who has smacked a child, but we'll leave that for Stage 3.",
      "Julie Morgan AM : We'll be dealing with that, I'm sure.",
      "Suzy Davies AM : But thank you; that was a helpful answer. Thank you, Chair.",
      "Lynne Neagle AM : Okay. Thank you. Are there any other questions from Members? No. Okay. Well, can I thank the Minister and the officials for attending this morning? As usual, you'll be sent a transcript to check for accuracy following the meeting, but thank you again for your attendance. Thank you.",
      "Julie Morgan AM : Thank you very much.",
      "Lynne Neagle AM : Okay. Item 4 is papers to note. There's just one today: the letter from the WLGA regarding the Childcare Funding (Wales) Act 2019 in response to our letter asking about the change in approach. Item 5 then. Can I propose, in accordance with Standing Order 17.42, that the committee resolves to meet in private for the remainder of the meeting? Are Members content? Thank you."

She 's actually suggested to look um , at the psychology department students , because they have to partake in two experiments in order to fulfill some requirements . So they have to be subjected , {vocalsound} {comment} before they can actually graduate . And um , we want to design it so that they really have to think about having some time , two days , for example , to plan certain things and figure out which can be done at what time , and , um , sort of package the whole thing in a {disfmarker} in a re in a few more complicated um , structure . That 's for the data collection . As for SmartKom , I 'm {disfmarker} the last SmartKom meeting I mentioned that we have some problems with the synthesis , which as of this morning should be resolved . And , so ,",

Plus , Johno and I are meeting tomorrow , so maybe uh uh , when tomorrow is over , we 're done . And ha n hav we 'll never have to look at it again Maybe it 'll take some more time , to be realistic , but at least we 're {disfmarker} we 're seeing the end of the tunnel there . That was that . Um , the uh , uh I don't think we need to discuss the formalism that 'll be done officially s once we 're done . Um , something happened , in {disfmarker} on Eva 's side with the PRM that we 're gonna look at today , and um , we have a visitor from Bruchsal from the International University .

      "Project Manager : Yeah .",

We can change the tasks slightly if we feel that we should have data for e sort of for every decision node so {disfmarker} trying to im um {disfmarker} implant the intention of going to a place now , going to a place later on the same tour , or trying to plant the intention of going sometime on the next tour , or the next day or whenever .",

      "Professor D : So {disfmarker} Yeah . So let me pop up a level . And uh s s make sure that we 're all oriented the same . So What we 're gonna do today is two related things . Uh one of them is to work on the semantics of the belief - net which is going to be the main inference engine for thi the system uh making decisions . And decisions are going to turn out to be parameter choices for calls on other modules . so f the natural language understanding thing is uh , we think gonna only have to choose parameters , but You know , a fairly large set of parameters . So to do that , we need to do two things . One of which is figure out what all the choices are , which we 've done a fair amount . Then we need to figure out what influences its choices and finally we have to do some technical work on the actual belief relations and presumably estimates of the probabilities and stuff . But we aren't gonna do the probability stuff today . Technical stuff we 'll do {disfmarker} uh {disfmarker} another day . Probably next week . But we are gonna worry about all the decisions and the things that pert that contribute to them . And we 're also , sort of uh in the same process , going to work with Fey on what there should be in the dialogues . So One of the s steps that 's coming up real soon is to actually get subjects uh {disfmarker} in here , and have them actually record like this . Uh record dialogues more or less . And {disfmarker} depending on what Fey sort of provokes them to say , we 'll get information on different things .",
      "Grad C : Well how people phrase different intentions more or less ,",
      "Professor D : So {disfmarker} Fo - v yeah people with the {disfmarker} phrase them",
      "Grad C : huh ?",
      "Professor D : and so {disfmarker} Uh for , you know , Keith and people worrying about what constructions people use , uh {disfmarker} we have some i we have some ways to affect that by the way the dialogues go . So what Robert kindly did , is to lay out a table of the kinds of uh {pause} things that {disfmarker} that might come up , and , the kinds of decisions . So the uh {disfmarker} uh {disfmarker} on the left are decision nodes , and discreet values . So if {disfmarker} if we 're right , you can get by with um just this middle column worth of decisions , and it 's not all that many , and it 's perfectly feasible technically to build belief - nets that will do that . And he has a handout .",
      "Grad C : Yeah . Maybe it was too fast plunging in there , because j we have two updates .",
      "Professor D : Yeah .",
      "Grad C : Um you can look at this if you want , these are what our subject 's going to have to fill out . Any comments I can {disfmarker} can still be made and the changes will be put in correspondingly .",

      "Grad A : OK .",

They decided that this remote control should be special and not like the regular black thing with some buttons on it. Its size shouldn't be too big nor too small because it has to have a lot of functions. The idea of a foldable mobile phone shape emerged. They would keep the general functions on top and the less-used function buttons would be inside. The possibility to have a touchscreen was quickly put aside for being too expensive and also too fragile. The remote control being one of the things falling the most, it needed to be strong. Charging the device was the next big question: batteries or chargeable, with a home station or a recharger? The idea of the base allows to not lose the remote control so often, but it might be too expensive. It was decided to use to the possibility to have the option between batteries and the recharger.",

      "Industrial Designer : one to go up left right down and uh enter",

      "Industrial Designer : Yeah but {disfmarker}",

      "Project Manager : It's {disfmarker}",
      "User Interface : Mm . Mm .",

      "User Interface : Mm .",
      "Marketing : I mean it doe it also doesn't require a voice command ,",
      "Project Manager : But you don't you don't have to move the the charger .",
      "Industrial Designer : Yeah .",
      "Marketing : because there are problems with a voice command .",

      "Marketing : I mean charger would be fixed",

      "Industrial Designer : Yeah .",
      "User Interface : because uh every time you're off the computer {vocalsound} {disfmarker} the T_V_ you are asked the the command the T_V_ com remote controller would tell you to put it back to where {disfmarker} to the charger .",

      "Industrial Designer : Okay .",
      "Project Manager : Maybe for some people {gap} {vocalsound} lazy people .",

      "Project Manager : Yeah .",
      "User Interface : Mm .",
      "Industrial Designer : yeah . So for my part I will check the prices the um the prices difference uh of what to use , where to use , and s uh and so on .",

      "Industrial Designer : Yeah .",
      "User Interface : Mm . {vocalsound} I think we need to define also a s the set of vocabularies for the speech recogniser",
      "Industrial Designer : Yeah .",
      "User Interface : because uh if you want {gap} uh say we can sort by channels or sort by T_V_ programs , you have to decide a category of vocabularies for them . If numbers , they're easy ,",
      "Project Manager : Mm-hmm .",
      "User Interface : but if {gap} name the channel by by name {disfmarker}",
      "Industrial Designer : Well I think we can we can have just numbers for channels and you can say to your remote control like uh sports and then on the T_V_ you have a list with with uh uh well with sports program playing now",
      "User Interface : Mm .",
      "Industrial Designer : and and uh {disfmarker}",
      "Marketing : No , we have a problem there . You see uh if you have a voice commands and you are s you are watching a score on uh {disfmarker} basketball score or something , and if the score comes twenty four thirty five , you've just say twenty five",
      "Project Manager : Yeah it's {disfmarker} yeah .",
      "Marketing : and suddenly {vocalsound} the screen the channel goes to twenty five .",
      "User Interface : Mm .",
      "Industrial Designer : That's right , yeah , yeah .",
      "Marketing : So I think there should be a prefix to some numbers {disfmarker}",
      "Industrial Designer : Well but well e every possible word uh has a probability to come about of the T_V_ so . {vocalsound}",
      "User Interface : Yeah .",
      "Marketing : I mean the the {disfmarker} you just check all the probability that saying T_V_ twenty five and just ordinary twenty five .",
      "User Interface : Mm .",
      "Industrial Designer : Yeah yeah .",
      "Marketing : Ordinary twenty five you almost there's a probability of being said around sixty seventy percent",
      "User Interface : Mm .",
      "Industrial Designer : Yeah but well {disfmarker} okay .",
      "Marketing : and T_V_ twenty five I dunno it will be round about one or two percent .",
      "User Interface : Mm .",
      "Project Manager : Mm-hmm .",
      "User Interface : Mm .",
      "Marketing : So it's better to have some prefix {gap} before the number .",
      "User Interface : But I I I think that the user would like wou would like to associate the channel or call the channel rather than than the numbers .",
      "Marketing : Yeah something , some code .",
      "User Interface : You say numbe channel number five of the T_V_ correspond to something else in the channel .",
      "Industrial Designer : Yeah yeah .",
      "User Interface : So some people may want to say , I want to see this channel .",
      "Industrial Designer : Mm mm . Well I {disfmarker}",
      "Marketing : That will be too big .",
      "Project Manager : Or just {disfmarker}",
      "Marketing : And it will be difficult for the vocabulary also .",
      "User Interface : Yeah . Check with the v R_ and D_ department the capability of recogniser .",
      "Project Manager : It's difficult to to just say the the name of the channel . It will be difficult to say just the name of the channel .",
      "User Interface : {vocalsound} Uh ?",
      "Project Manager : Because you have to s t uh a ch",
      "User Interface : Well , it's convenient for the user .",
      "Project Manager : yeah but you have to to have all the name of the channel in your vocabulary .",
      "Marketing : Als might be you just forgot the channel name , you kno only know the number .",
      "Project Manager : Or maybe {disfmarker}",
      "Industrial Designer : Yeah .",
      "Marketing : Then {disfmarker}",
      "Project Manager : Or maybe the user can create his own vocabulary ,",
      "User Interface : The {disfmarker} uh uh mm . {vocalsound} Mm .",
      "Project Manager : just pronouncing the the name of channels and include in the vocabulary .",
      "User Interface : I I think that I have {disfmarker} mm mm {vocalsound} I think there's another way you can do is that uh you can uh {vocalsound} if {disfmarker} when the user ch press a button to choose the channel for example , then what you can do is that the {disfmarker} you can make the T_V_ screen to split them into small little little squares of images where you you you have a snapshot of every channel , so let's say it's a four by four matrix of the images , so now what you do is f looking at the all the sixteen channels available at one time , you just use the control button uh , you just you you just choose the the option you want",
      "Marketing : Yeah , the {gap} .",
      "User Interface : and then you just hit the button and then you go to that channel . So {disfmarker}",
      "Project Manager : Or lets the user create his own vocabulary of channel .",
      "User Interface : Mm . So you you don't use the speech recogniser in that way .",
      "Project Manager : No . Just you have uh in the beginning you have uh t you have to train {disfmarker} you have to create the vocabulary by yourself .",
      "User Interface : Oh , okay . Yeah .",
      "Industrial Designer : Well I uh I also {disfmarker}",
      "Project Manager : By associating each channel with the name or {disfmarker}",
      "Industrial Designer : I I also think about uh another problem , if if there is uh more than one person who is watching T_V_ {vocalsound}",
      "Project Manager : And for each one has his own . {vocalsound}",
      "User Interface : {vocalsound}",
      "Industrial Designer : the s well the the speech uh r recogniser should be able to distinguish between the two .",
      "Marketing : Yeah yeah , {gap} .",
      "Industrial Designer : Because uh I remember when I was a {vocalsound} young child with my sister we {disfmarker} yeah we always want to w to watch different emission at the at the same time",
      "User Interface : Mm .",
      "Project Manager : Or you have to s {vocalsound}",
      "User Interface : Yeah , I wanna watch this , I wanna watch that .",
      "Marketing : Yeah .",
      "Industrial Designer : so it's a pr it could be a problem if uh if well if someone passes by when you are watching T_V_ and say oh T_V_ thirty {vocalsound} and just run , s",
      "User Interface : Mm .",
      "Marketing : A and in the same lines we would have a {disfmarker} one more problem . If we are using the television in the different environments , say in the factories or in the shops where there is a lot of noise and this voice commands if they fail to work , that would bring a bad name {disfmarker} bad uh reputation for our company .",
      "Industrial Designer : Yeah , yeah .",
      "Project Manager : Yeah .",
      "User Interface : Mm .",
      "Project Manager : Mm .",

      "Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Yeah .",
      "Project Manager : Or we can switch on or switch off the the special {gap} , yeah .",
      "Marketing : Yeah that's right that should be an option .",
      "User Interface : Mm .",
      "Industrial Designer : Yeah that's {disfmarker} well I think that's a good uh a good option because it's simple and uh simple to implement also , so .",
      "User Interface : Hmm .",

And , um , the {disfmarker} um , he @ @ might tell us a little bit about what he 's actually doing , and why it is s somewhat related , and {disfmarker} by uh using maybe some of the same technologies that we are using . And um . Was that enough of an update ?",

      "Grad D : Uh , yeah , sure . Um , so , I 've be just been looking at , um , Ack ! What are you doing ? Yeah . OK . Um , I 've been looking at the PRM stuff . Um , so , this is , sort of like the latest thing I have on it , and I sorta constructed a couple of classes . Like , a user class , a site class , and {disfmarker} and you know , a time , a route , and then {disfmarker} and a query class . And I tried to simplify it down a little bit , so that I can actually um , look at it more . It 's the same paper that I gave to Jerry last time . Um , so basically I took out a lot of stuff , a lot of the decision nodes , and then tried to {disfmarker} The red lines on the , um , graph are the um , relations between the different um , classes . Like , a user has like , a query , and then , also has , you know um , reference slots to its preferences , um , the special needs and , you know , money , and the user interest . And so this is more or less similar to the flat Bayes - net that I have , you know , with the input nodes and all that . And {disfmarker} So I tried to construct the dependency models , and a lot of these stuff I got from the flat Bayes - net , and what they depend on , and it turns out , you know , the CPT 's are really big , if I do that , so I tried to see how I can do , um {disfmarker} put in the computational nodes in between . And what that would look like in a PRM . And so I ended up making several classes {disfmarker} Actually , you know , a class of {disfmarker} with different attributes that are the intermediate nodes , and one of them is like , time affordability money affordability , site availability , and the travel compatibility . And so some of these classes are {disfmarker} s some of these attributes only depend on stuff from , say , the user , or s f just from , I don't know , like the site . S like , um , these here , it 's only like , user , but , if you look at travel compatibility for each of these factors , you need to look at a pair of , you know , what the um , preference of the user is versus , you know , what type of an event it is , or you know , which form of transportation the user has and whether , you know , the onsite parking matters to the user , in that case . And that makes the scenario a little different in a PRM , because , um , then you have one - user objects and potentially you can have many different sites in {disfmarker} in mind . And so for each of the site you 'll come up with this rating , of travel compatibility . And , they all depend on the same users , but different sites , and that makes a {disfmarker} I 'm tr I w I wa have been trying to see whether the PRM would make it more efficient if we do inferencing like that . And so , I guess you end up having fewer number of nodes than in a flat Bayes - net , cuz otherwise you would {disfmarker} c well , it 's probably the same . But um , No , you would definitely have {disfmarker} be able to re - use , like , {vocalsound} um , all the user stuff , and not {disfmarker} not having to recompute a lot of the stuff , because it 's all from the user side . So if you changed sites , you {disfmarker} you can , you know , save some work on that . But , you know , in the case where , it depends on both the user and the site , then I 'm still having a hard time trying to see how um , using the PRM will help . Um , so anyhow , using those intermediate nodes then , this {disfmarker} this would be the class that represent the intermediate nodes . And that would {disfmarker} basically it 's just another class in the model , with , you know , references to the user and the site and the time . And then , after you group them together this {disfmarker} no the dependencies would {disfmarker} of the queries would be reduced to this . And so , you know , it 's easier to specify the CPT and all . Um , so I think that 's about as far as I 've gone on the PRM stuff .",

      "Professor F : No . So y you didn't yet tell us what the output is .",
      "Grad D : The output .",
      "Professor F : So what decisions does this make ?",
      "Grad D : OK . So it only makes two decisions , in this model . And one is basically how desirable a site is meaning , um , how good it matches the needs of a user . And the other is the mode of the visit , whether th It 's the EVA decision . Um , so , instead of um , {vocalsound} doing a lot of , you know , computation about , you know , which one site it wants of {disfmarker} the user wants to visit , I 'll come {disfmarker} well , try to come up with like , sort of a list of sites . And for each site , you know , where {disfmarker} h how {disfmarker} how well it fits , and basically a rating of how well it fits and what to do with it . So . Anything else I missed ?",
      "Professor F : So that was pretty quick . She 's ac uh uh Eva 's got a little write - up on it that uh , probably gives the {disfmarker} the details to anybody who needs them . Um , so the {disfmarker} You {disfmarker} you didn't look at all yet to see if there 's anybody has a implementation .",

      "Professor F : OK . So one {disfmarker} so one of the questions , you know , about these P R Ms is",

      "Professor F : uh , we aren't gonna build our own interpreter , so if {disfmarker} if we can't find one , then we uh , go off and do something else and wait until s one appears . Uh , so one of the things that Eva 's gonna do over the next few weeks is see if we can track that down . Uh , the people at Stanford write papers as if they had one , but , um , we 'll see . So w Anyway . So that 's a {disfmarker} a major open issue . If there is an interpreter , it looks like you know , what Eva 's got should run and we should be able to actually um , try to solve , you know , the problems , to actually take the data , and do it . Uh , and we 'll see . Uh , I actually think it is cleaner , and the ability to instantiate , you know , instance of people and sites and stuff , um , will help in the expression . Whether the inference gets any faster or not I don't know . Uh , it wouldn't surprise me if it {disfmarker} if it doesn't .",

I mean , the notion of instantiating your el elements from the ontology and stuff fits this very nicely and doesn't fit very well into the extended belief - net . So that was one of the main reasons for doing it . Um . I don't know . So , uh , people who have thought about the problem , like Robert i it looked to me like if {comment} Eva were able to come up with a {vocalsound} you know , value for each of a number of uh , sites plus its EVA thing , that a travel planner should be able to take it from there .

      "Janet Finch-Saunders AM : Thank you. And, then, to what extent are schools aware of the impact of early trauma ACEs, and how are schools adapting their practices to take account of them?",
      "Dr Ian Johnson : I don't think we're really capable of saying that on an individual level. We're aware, as you've heard from previous evidence from heads of education, et cetera, directors of education, that work is going on on an all-Wales basis, and there's obviously an awful lot of work that's going on on the ACEs agenda. I referred to being a previous school governor, and that's somewhere that's become a trauma-informed school, and they have established that and are widening that base. I think that what the school does though is something that has to loop back, as I said, with the curriculum changes as we're going forward. There's a concern that I have at the moment regarding the progress on EOTAS and PRU within the new curriculum, and there's work that I think will still need to be done, and something that I'm sure will be considered by this committee when it deals with the curriculum assessment Bill when it comes forward later on in the year, because there were comments made by the education Minister, I think, in response to Suzy Davies, in the statement in January, that we're talking about disallowing areas of the curriculum on the basis of the individual learner, to which I have no concern in itself. However, the emotional and mental health well-being needs of this particularly vulnerable group of people needs to be centre stage. So, the role of the health and well-being area of learning and experience, and the role of mental health and emotional well-being within the curriculum, is hugely important.",
      "Sarah Stone : And I think, just to add to that around the impact of early trauma, I think one of the things that we at Samaritans are particularly aware of is the impact of loneliness and isolation on individuals and how that can help to drive distress and suicidal ideation. That sense of belongingness is recognised by the research as being critical to functioning well as a human being. We are social beings. And one of the ways in which early trauma and adversity, if that leads to exclusion from a range of groups, is to lead to lifelong isolation. It's something that comes out when you look at middle-aged men. You look at a trajectory that goes back towards their early years, very often, and Samaritans is about to release some research on that very point. So, there's a connection between what happens in later life and what happens here. There's also, if we look at the numbers of exclusions around boys, and we're looking at much higher suicide rates and numbers of other issues around men\u2014. Again, I think it's important to see this whole picture\u2014",
      "Janet Finch-Saunders AM : It's very bad in north Wales. Our figures are very worrying.",
      "Sarah Stone : Yes, exactly. So, there's a bigger picture here. I would say that we want to do something to mitigate the impact of adverse childhood experiences, and we have this great opportunity to release the potential of those young people whose, often, strength and resilience is quite extraordinary in circumstances that many of us would find hard to imagine. So, we need to look at the assets that young people have as well, which you can work with. So, I think if there's a real opportunity to create a change, this is one of them. This issue about exclusions and PRUs\u2014this is a chance to make that ambition real.",
      "Janet Finch-Saunders AM : Thank you so much. Very good.",
      "Liz Williams : Just to reiterate what Sarah said, looking at our research, which, obviously, isn't yet published but will be soon, it really is quite shocking how these men fell through the net so many times when they were young, and, actually, how many missed opportunities there were to intervene in the cycles of inequality. It is quite clear from that research that these stages where children are demonstrating challenging behaviour are the first signs of distress. So actually, this is where we should be intervening. So, I think like Sarah said, it is really important to see this as a preventative agenda.",

User Interface wondered from where would the sound signal be executed, arguing another device wouldn't be a solution. The idea of something like clapping, but using new technologies, was discussed. Industrial Designer mentioned the find the remote control button that some video sets had, but the problem was that not all TVs had those buttons, and they had no control over the TV set. Industrial Designer said it was complicated to separate the clapping sound from other sounds, as the characteristics were an increase in the volume and the amplitude of sound, so the remote could confuse some sound and beep; so User Interface suggested having a base station next to the TV, so people could have a central point to which they could go and press a button to make the remote reported itself. Everyone agreed and decided to find alternatives for the lighting function, because the sound signal would be costly.",

Alright . Sorry , let's go through this . Alright . Here we go . New product requirements . First it's only going to be a T_V_ remote . We're trying not to over-complicate things .

So that would include battery source {disfmarker} Power source rather . Is it going to have a charger , or is it going to be run strictly off batteries ? And we also need to deal with the issue you mentioned of speech recognition , if we want that .",

      "Marketing : It wouldn't copy onto the the thing 'cause it's black ,",

      "User Interface : Well {disfmarker}",
      "Marketing : just sitcoms and stuff . Right .",
      "User Interface : Well , then then do you put the voice recognition {disfmarker} do you put the r like receiver on the actual television , in the base , or in the actual remote ,",
      "Marketing : So {disfmarker}",
      "User Interface : 'cause then you've already got remote in your hand , why you just gonna speak to the remote ,",
      "Project Manager : Right .",
      "User Interface : whereas if you just speak in general and you don't have to have the remote in your hand and like talk at it .",
      "Project Manager : Yeah . {gap} and the speech recognition could be part of the lost and found device , too . If we said , find remote , locate remote , or something .",
      "Marketing : Right .",
      "Project Manager : A certain phrase then it could beep . I dunno . Just throwing it out there .",
      "Marketing : Yeah .",

      "Marketing : Wait , on the remote itself ?",
      "Project Manager : {gap}",
      "User Interface : Yeah , like you have one , two , three , four , five , six , seven , eight , nine , zero .",
      "Project Manager : How how ,",

      "Project Manager : yeah , how would you leave those out ?",
      "Industrial Designer : Yeah .",
      "User Interface : Well , I don't know , I mean , if you can {gap} like well {disfmarker}",
      "Project Manager : Unless you could say the channel .",
      "User Interface : I don't know , if there's just a way of leaving them out ?",
      "Industrial Designer : I think people would find that too foreign .",
      "Project Manager : Yeah , that's true .",
      "Marketing : Yeah .",
      "Project Manager : And also remember that in this day in age we need , you know , like a hundred button , too .",
      "Marketing : You definitely need {disfmarker}",
      "Project Manager : I used to have a remote that did not even go up past like fifty . {vocalsound} So I couldn't {disfmarker} whenever I got cable , I had to get a new T_V_ .",
      "Industrial Designer : It's when we get satellite .",
      "Project Manager : Mm . {gap} get your own remote , or digital cable .",
      "Industrial Designer : Yeah .",
      "Project Manager : 'Kay . Um . I guess , we're gonna discuss the project financing later , making sure that we can fit all of the stuff that we want to on our budget . Um .",
      "Industrial Designer : Yeah , 'cause I don't have any material pricing information available to me at the moment , so {disfmarker}",

      "Industrial Designer : Yeah , {vocalsound} yellow could be and it could {disfmarker} doesn't have to be huge .",
      "User Interface : Well if you have like a {vocalsound} {disfmarker}",
      "Marketing : Yeah .",
      "User Interface : Hang on . If you have this sort of strip kind of down at the bottom {gap} the base of it , just like yellow with the R_R_ .",

      "User Interface : Right , yeah .",
      "Project Manager : or no menu buttons .",
      "Marketing : Yeah .",

      "User Interface : Yeah .",
      "Project Manager : Which one is yours , technical functions or functional requirement ?",
      "User Interface : Oh , it's a {disfmarker} Yeah .",
      "Project Manager : Okay .",

      "Project Manager : The T_V_ . I think that that's fine just for the T_V_ . I mean how often does the average user need to do that kind of stuff ?",
      "User Interface : Well , the other option is sort of like down at the bottom , like farther away , you just have this sort of box inset where it's like the buttons that you don't use as much , but occasionally you will use .",
      "Project Manager : Hmm .",
      "User Interface : and so it's like {disfmarker}",
      "Marketing : Yeah , 'cause we need to {disfmarker} we definitely need to have buttons for like sub-titles and things like that . It's 'cause the foreign film market is expanding and stuff , and like on television like I know f k living in Los Angeles it's tons of Spanish network television if it has English sub-titles it's definitely helpful .",

      "User Interface : Yeah .",
      "Project Manager : That one ?",

Well , since it's the {disfmarker} through the whole technology type thing , um , you were saying in the market research that people like kind of interesting gadgets in them .

I {vocalsound} {vocalsound} I have to be more careful about using that as a {disfmarker} as a {disfmarker} {vocalsound} as a good illustration , uh , in fact it 's not , of uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} of the effects of room reverberation . It is isn't a bad illustration of the effects of uh room noise . {vocalsound} on {disfmarker} on uh some mikes uh but So .

But uh Dan is pretty confident that we 're not , that {disfmarker} that quantization error is not {disfmarker} is still not a significant {vocalsound} factor there . So . So there was a question of whether we should change things here , whether we should {vocalsound} change a capacitor on the input box for that or whether we should",

      "Professor A : A simple thing to do is he {disfmarker} he {disfmarker} he has a {disfmarker} I forget if it {disfmarker} this was in that mail or in the following mail , but he has a {disfmarker} a simple filter , a digital filter that he suggested . We just run over the data before we deal with it .",

But {disfmarker}",
      "Grad G : And , um , actually , regarding the phase normalization {disfmarker} So I did two experiments , and one is {disfmarker} So , phases get added , modulo two pi , and {disfmarker} because you only know the phase of the complex number t t to a value modulo two pi . And so I thought at first , um , that , uh , what I should do is unwrap the phase because that will undo that . Um , but I actually got worse results doing that unwrapping using the simple phase unwrapper that 's in Matlab than I did not unwrapping at all .",

      "Professor B : Yeah . So I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm still hopeful that {disfmarker} that {disfmarker} I mean , we {disfmarker} we don't even know if the phase {vocalsound} is something {disfmarker} the average phase is something that we do want to remove . I mean , maybe there 's some deeper reason why it isn't the right thing to do . But , um , at least in principle it looks like there 's {disfmarker} there 's , uh , a couple potential ways to do it . One {disfmarker} one being to just work with the complex numbers , um , and , uh {disfmarker} in rectangular kind of coordinates . And the other is {vocalsound} to , uh , do a Taylor series {disfmarker} Well . So you work with the complex numbers and then when you get the spectrum {disfmarker} the average complex spectrum {disfmarker} um , actually divide it out , um , as opposed to taking the log and subtracting . So then , um , um , you know , there might be some numerical issues . We don't really know that . The other thing we talked a little bit about was Taylor series expansion . And , um , uh , actually I was talking to Dick Karp about it a little bit , and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and , since I got thinking about it , and {disfmarker} and , uh , so one thing is that y you 'd have to do , I think , uh {disfmarker} we may have to do this on a whiteboard , but I think you have to be a little careful about scaling the numbers that you 're {vocalsound} taking {disfmarker} the complex numbers that you 're taking the log of because {vocalsound} the Taylor expansion for it has , you know , a square and a cube , and {disfmarker} and so forth . And {disfmarker} and so if {disfmarker} {vocalsound} if you have a {disfmarker} a number that is modulus , you know , uh , very different from one {disfmarker} {vocalsound} It should be right around one , if it 's {disfmarker} cuz it 's a expansion of log one {disfmarker} one minus epsilon or o is {disfmarker} is {vocalsound} one plus epsilon , or is it one plus {disfmarker} ? Well , there 's an epsilon squared over two and an epsilon cubed over three ,",
      "Grad G : OK .",
      "Professor B : and so forth . So if epsilon is bigger than one , then it diverges .",
      "Grad G : Oh .",
      "Professor B : So you have to do some scaling . But that 's not a big deal cuz it 's the log of {disfmarker} {vocalsound} of K times a complex number , then you can just {disfmarker} that 's the same as log of K plus {vocalsound} log of the complex number .",
      "Grad G : Oh .",
      "Professor B : Uh , so there 's {disfmarker}",

      "Eluned Morgan AM : I think it is important. What we've said is that we want to maintain that range of learning opportunities that is provided by EU funding. I think we've got to be clear that we are not working to this scenario. I think we've got to\u2014. The UK Government have made us some promises and they've made some commitments, and we need to hold them to that, and so let's keep the pressure on. The moment we start saying, 'No, it's all going to be okay, we'll sort ourselves out'\u2014I think that would be a huge mistake. We have been promised that we will not lose a penny as a result of Brexit, and we need to make sure that we keep them to that commitment. I think it was quite interesting to hear what Philip Hammond said yesterday when he was in Wales, saying that the money that we will receive will depend on the future shape of the economy, which implies that he has no idea what's going to happen there, and that that shared prosperity fund will be designed around the deal. Well, that's really not what we're interested in. We were made some promises, and we need them to commit to those promises. I think we have some real concerns about the shared prosperity fund not really following through on the commitments that were made during the Brexit referendum. But, in terms of the replacements, we'd be looking at about \u00a315 million a year, and that would be a huge impact for us, but we're not looking at that\u2014I don't think we should be\u2014because they made some promises.",
      "John Griffiths AM : So, could you say that, if they keep their promises, then at least that level of funding would be maintained?",
      "Eluned Morgan AM : I think that would be a minimum, but that's just one aspect of it. That's not including the whole workplace learning money on top of that.",
      "John Griffiths AM : Okay.",
      "Lynne Neagle AM : Thank you. Suzy, you had a supplementary.",
      "Suzy Davies AM : Yes, just very quickly on the multi-annual point, obviously I recognise that we're talking about six or seven-year cycles with Europe, and I completely take the point that you don't really know from year to year what your budget's going to be, but Welsh Government does make multi-annual commitments. I think you did it yesterday, actually\u2014the capital commitment is over more than one year. How are you able to do that and yet not quite feel confident that you can do that with\u2014well, both your sectors, really?",
      "Eluned Morgan AM : I think it's probably easier to do with capital than it is with revenue, so that's what would make the difference. But it's\u2014. These institutions are interested in revenue, because that's what supports the staff. The one thing we all know is that employment opportunities today\u2014the transitional nature of employment and the fact that people are not getting the kind of contracts that we'd like them to get\u2014that makes their lives very precarious and they're less likely, then, to be committed to those institutions. I think it's a really, really concerning thing, because what makes these institutions work well is their staff, so that makes life very, very difficult without that multi-annual commitment.",
      "Suzy Davies AM : They also have to raise some of their own money as well\u2014we mustn't forget that.",
      "Eluned Morgan AM : No, I think that's right, and I think that there's more that these institutions can do in terms of their own funding and being more responsive to employers and the need for skills in their areas.",
      "Suzy Davies AM : Okay, thank you. Thank you, Chair.",
      "Lynne Neagle AM : So, given the precarious state of planning for the finances, are you considering letting universities charge EU students international fees?",
      "Kirsty Williams AM : We don't regulate the ability for universities to set fees for international students. They would be in a position to\u2014[Inaudible.] They are in a position to set international fees at a rate that, I guess, they feel is appropriate for the provision that they give to those students.",
      "Lynne Neagle AM : Okay, right. We'll move on, then, to questions from Llyr.",
      "Llyr Gruffydd AM : Thank you. I just wanted to pick up on the funding of apprenticeships and the long-term funding, because the ESF\u2014the commitments take us to 2023, which takes us beyond any transition period. So, I just want to hear from you that there are assurances that the apprenticeship programme can be delivered as a whole, come what may.",
      "Eluned Morgan AM : Well, we're fine until 2020, because we've had that guarantee from the Government. The issue for us is the n+2 that we would have if we do have some kind of transition deal or an agreement with the EU. So, there is a risk and there is concern, beyond 2020, that that would create problems if they don't agree to fund that, which is the expectation that we have.",
      "Llyr Gruffydd AM : But it is a prospect that this wouldn't be achieved as you foresee.",
      "Eluned Morgan AM : Well, we do hope, because we've had the pledges and commitments from the Government, that they will respect what we expected and what was expected by these institutions that have had the commitment of the funding.",
      "Llyr Gruffydd AM : So, to what extent does that undermine the current work? Because institutions want to enter into agreements with providers and so on. Businesses want to know, if they're starting on some sort of journey, that they are going to get to the end of it some years down the line. That must be undermining a lot of the work that's going on now.",
      "Eluned Morgan AM : Well, as I said, because the guarantee is there until 2020, I think that, for now, people are willing to go into those agreements, and I hope that we'll have a better outlook by November of the direction we're moving in. But I don't think it's had an impact. You have to remember that the number of apprenticeships in Wales is rising, while they've collapsed entirely in England. So, it is important that we do continue, and it's important that we don't create an atmosphere here that's going to undermine the confidence of our employers in committing to training in the workplace.",
      "Llyr Gruffydd AM : Are you confident that the Government will achieve its targets in this context?",
      "Eluned Morgan AM : Yes. We're on target to reach 100,000 apprenticeships. I think we're slightly ahead of that target, I'm pleased to say. So, of course, our hope is to do that. But let's be clear: if there is a 'no deal' scenario, that will have an impact on the economy, and who knows what will happen then to some of these companies that are reliant on the EU."

      "Lynne Neagle AM : Okay, thank you. We're going to move on, then, to talk about student recruitment. I'm going to, because we've got a lot of questions, appeal for brief questions and answers that are as concise as possible, please. Hefin.",
      "Hefin David AM : How does the Welsh Government account for the fact that EU student applications in Wales this year\u2014that Wales is the only country in the UK to have seen a significant drop?",
      "Kirsty Williams AM : Okay, well, I think the first thing to remember is that we will not get a full picture of student recruitment until, first of all, November and then the true picture, because some institutions, as you would know, have two admissions dates\u2014we won't get the full picture until the spring. I think it was inevitable, given the change in Government policy with regard to student support, which had previously allowed European students to benefit from a tuition fee grant, and given the fact that that option is no longer available to them, that that has had an impact on EU recruitment, and there's no point trying to hide from that.",
      "Hefin David AM : So, together with leaving the EU, that's a double-whammy effect that's hitting Wales harder than the rest of the UK.",
      "Kirsty Williams AM : It just puts us in the same position as EU students applying to England, but it was inevitable. This was looked at by Diamond. It was anticipated that this could be a consequence of the change in policy, and I think we see that reflected in the initial figure, although, as I said, we won't get the true picture until the first census in November, and then, ultimately, the final picture in the spring.",
      "Hefin David AM : How concerned are you by that?",
      "Kirsty Williams AM : Clearly, we want our universities to be able to attract students from both the EU and from around the world. The fact that the tuition fee grant arrangements may have had an impact on European Union students at this stage does not preclude the fact that Wales, up until now, has been successful in recruiting international students. So, the change in the fee regime should not be a barrier to the recruitment of international students, because, actually, international students outside of the EU make up a bigger proportion of students not from the UK who come to our institutions.",
      "Hefin David AM : That's a fair point, but it's unfortunate timing, though, isn't it?",
      "Kirsty Williams AM : I think, from a public policy point of view and moving towards a sustainable way of funding our HE sector, then both my priority and, I would say, the priority of the institutions was to see the implementation of Diamond, which is what we have done.",
      "Hefin David AM : Okay, that's fine. What about the fact that we've got a relatively imbalanced higher education profile compared to other countries of the UK with regard to high, medium and low-tariff universities? We've got one high-tariff university, and they're the ones that tend to show the growth in recruitment of EU students. Are you concerned about that balance of profile in the HE sector?",
      "Kirsty Williams AM : As I said in answer to your question earlier, there is a difference reflected in the exposure of institutions to EU and international students. I would argue that it's not necessarily the case that institutions that are not high-tariff are not able to do very well in this sector.\u00a0If you look, for instance, at Swansea University\u2014if you look at the work Swansea\u00a0University has done, that shows you what is possible.",
      "Hefin David AM : What is Swansea's success, then? What can we learn from Swansea?",
      "Kirsty Williams AM : What I think is important\u2014and this is not about any one institution\u2014what I think is really important is that we look to\u2014. And I can't force institutions\u00a0to do this. It's a combination, I believe, for all universities, of getting their offer right\u2014so, having a curriculum at their institution that is attractive and offers courses that people want to study. It's about that curriculum being delivered in an excellent fashion, so high quality\u00a0ratings for teaching, as well as having an infrastructure\u00a0that is attractive to students. So, it's all about getting the offer right and providing what students, both domestically and internationally, want.",
      "Hefin David AM : But the evidence would therefore suggest that that model of success that you've just outlined is happening in Swansea but it isn't happening in other institutions, and they're seeing a drop.",
      "Kirsty Williams AM : Well, as I said, I think what we can see from Cardiff, Swansea and others is that it is possible to do very well in the sector.",
      "Hefin David AM : So, Cardiff, Swansea and Bangor\u2014but the others, not.",
      "Kirsty Williams AM : As I said, what we can see is that, if you get the offer right, I think we have something very special that the HE sector can market itself on.",
      "Lynne Neagle AM : Llyr, you've got a supplementary.",
      "Llyr Gruffydd AM : Just coming back to the drop in EU students, you mentioned that one of the reasons probably is the change in the funding that's available to students coming here. So, does that suggest that, under the current regime, Wales was punching above its weight in terms of attracting students and we've lost that advantage? I know we're gaining in other ways in introducing\u00a0the new system, but really we're not much different to England in terms of fees now, so why would they come to Wales as opposed to going anywhere else?",
      "Kirsty Williams AM : I think you're right; there was an added incentive, potentially, to come to a Welsh\u00a0institution because\u00a0of the availability of the tuition\u00a0fee grant. That advantage is no longer there, which is why we need to work alongside the sector, as we're doing with the Global Wales programme, to increase their ability to market HE in the round across the world. I think we've got a strong offer that we can speak to people about. I'm very proud of what our institutions can deliver for people. It's a fantastic, warm environment to come and study in, at great institutions. There's something for everybody, whether you want to be in a city like Cardiff or whether you want a coastal experience in a small town like Aber. So, we've got a lot to offer and that's why it's really important that, although we have seen a change in the tuition\u00a0fees, which may have an impact, we are investing with universities, for instance, in the Global Wales programme.",
      "Lynne Neagle AM : In terms of the drop that we've seen in Wales, which is differential amongst\u00a0institutions, will you be taking any specific action to try and prevent Brexit exacerbating\u00a0that?",
      "Kirsty Williams AM : We are working with HEFCW and individual\u00a0institutions, as I said, to test their preparedness. We can't tell them what to do in that sense, but we can, because of our governance arrangements and HEFCW's monitoring arrangements, continue to test with them. I meet regularly\u00a0with vice-chancellors and separately\u00a0with the chairs of the institutions and separately\u00a0again with HEFCW representatives, and the sustainability\u00a0of the sector and recruitment issues is always something that is on the agenda.",
      "Lynne Neagle AM : Thank you. Julie."
